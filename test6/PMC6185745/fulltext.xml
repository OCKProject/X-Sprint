The early emergence of filaments in evolutionary history suggests that filament genesis might be a robust process. Here we describe the fortuitous construction of GFP fusion proteins that self-assemble as fluorescent polar filaments in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Filament formation is achieved by appending as few as 12 residues. Crystal structures reveal that the protomers each donate an appendage to fill a groove between two following protomers along the filament. This exchange of appendages resembles runaway domain swapping but is distinguished by higher efficiency because monomers cannot competitively bind their own appendages. Ample evidence of this &#x0201c;runaway domain coupling&#x0201d; mechanism in nature suggests it could facilitate the evolutionary pathway from globular protein to polar filament, requiring a minimal extension of protein sequence and no significant refolding.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">The self-association of proteins to form filaments is the basis for the formation of essential cytoskeletal elements such as actin and tubulin in all three domains of life. Cytoskeletal elements participate in a variety of critical cellular processes including DNA segregation, cell division, morphogenesis, cell motility, maintenance of cell shape, and the transport of cellular cargoes. The identification of diverse families of actin and tubulin homologs in prokaryotes over the last 20 years<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> has led to the suggestion that these are ancient proteins that predate the split between bacteria, archaea and eukarya<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the recent discovery that certain metabolic enzymes can polymerize as filaments has provoked the suggestion that an original rudimentary cytoskeleton may have evolved in an ancestral cell through the repurposing of enzyme polymerization<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">The early emergence of filaments in biological history raises the question of what structural mechanisms are capable of establishing filament-competent interfaces, and how facile is their evolution. One mechanism requiring few specific structural features other than a globular fold is runaway 3-dimensional domain swapping. By this mechanism, the intermolecular interface between successive protomers in the filament recapitulates an intramolecular interface that exists within the isolated monomer<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Thus, a domain of the protein, usually residing at either the N- or C-terminus and connected to the remainder of the protein by a flexible linker (the so-called hinge-loop), exchanges its intramolecular contacts for otherwise identical intermolecular contacts, an exchange that usually occurs only under non-native conditions. Runaway domain swapping occurs in a unidirectional fashion, with each subunit donating a domain to the next, leading to the formation of an open-ended protofilament. Examples include fibrils of a designed 3-&#x003b1;-helix bundle<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, filaments of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, and ribbons of &#x0201c;cab&#x0201d;-type carbonic anhydrase<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Runaway domain swapping has also been evidenced in some amyloid fibrils<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. (Note, we consider fibrils and filaments to be equivalent in the assembly hierarchy &#x02013; a level more complex than protofilaments &#x02013; and we use the term most closely associated with the particular system discussed.)</p><p id="P6">A simpler, more obvious mechanism for filament formation is the stacking of domains in an end-to-end fashion. Other than runaway domain swapping and end-to-end stacking, no other naturally occurring mechanisms for filament formation have been formally categorized despite the recent rapid increase in the number of filament structures determined.</p><p id="P7">Here we describe a nested set of GFP fusion proteins with a shared ability to self-assemble as fluorescent filaments in bacterial cells. Remarkably, these filaments typically span the entire length of the cell. The smallest of these fusion proteins bears just 12 non-native amino acids at the C-terminus of GFP. Structure determination by x-ray crystallography revealed that these appended residues form an &#x003b1;-helix that extends away from the GFP domain (a &#x003b2;-barrel) through a hinge loop and docks into a groove formed by the following two &#x003b2;-barrels in the protofilament. We call this filament-forming mechanism &#x0201c;runaway domain coupling&#x0201d; because the protomer-protomer interfaces involve complementation between distinct donor and acceptor domains. It is distinct from end-to-end domain stacking where the protomer-protomer interfaces reside entirely within a single domain type. It is also distinct from runaway domain swapping, because the helix-in-groove complementation cannot be reproduced in the monomer. The fact that runaway domain coupling arose fortuitously suggests that the genesis of coupled interfaces is facile, an inference supported by our discovery of their occurrence in numerous natural filaments. We propose that the chances for such randomly generated surfaces to align in a productive interface are enhanced by a flexible hinge loop that connects the two domains of each protomer. Our findings illustrate a pathway whereby a non-polymerizing protein might evolve the ability to self-assemble as protofilaments and filaments.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>GFP-RNase A fusion proteins form fluorescent rods in bacterial cells.</title><p id="P8">Previous work from the Eisenberg group<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> demonstrated that RNase A variants containing short amyloidogenic peptide insertions in the C-terminal hinge loop could form amyloid-like fibrils <italic>in vitro</italic>. We sought to investigate whether or not these RNase A variants could also access the fibrillar form when produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. To do this, we constructed a plasmid vector that directed the inducible synthesis of RNase A (with or without an inserted amyloidogenic peptide sequence; see Methods) fused to a monomeric variant of GFP (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> ). Cells containing these plasmids were examined by fluorescence microscopy at various times after the induction of fusion protein synthesis. Whereas most cells contained diffuse fluorescence, we observed fluorescent rod structures in a small minority (1 to 2%) of cells. Such rod-containing cells typically contained a single rod (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, left). These structures were observed regardless of whether or not the RNase A moiety contained the amyloidogenic peptide insertion (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, left and data not shown). Furthermore, we found that refrigeration dramatically stimulated formation of the rod-like structures. When we grew cells overnight after the induction of fusion protein synthesis and then incubated the cell cultures for 2 hours at 4<sup>o</sup>C, we detected fluorescent rod structures in essentially all of the cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, right).</p><p id="P9">To define the sequence requirements for intracellular rod formation, we constructed a series of truncations from the C-terminus of RNase A (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We found that as few as eight N-terminal residues of RNase A (separated from the C-terminus of GFP by a three-residue linker) sufficed to permit rod formation. When cell cultures containing this construct were induced overnight and incubated for 2 hours at 4<sup>o</sup>C, essentially all of the cells contained fluorescent rods (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In most cases, the rods extended the entire length of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Rod formation does not depend on the fortuitous presence of an HP segment.</title><p id="P10">We considered the possibility that the propensities of the constructed GFP fusion proteins to form fluorescent rod structures was due to the fortuitous presence of an amino acid segment with high amyloid fiber-forming propensity (termed an HP segment) either spanning the fusion junction or contained wholly within the appended sequence. We discovered an HP segment comprising the 3-residue linker and the first 3 residues of RNase A (AMAKET) that was shared by our rod-forming constructs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig S1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P11">Results from mutagenesis experiments were inconsistent with the hypothesis that rod formation was due to the amyloid-forming propensity of the HP segment located at the N-terminal end of the appended peptide sequence. Using a fusion protein containing RNase A residues 1&#x02013;14 as our reference construct, we compared the rod-forming behaviors of the reference fusion [GFP-A<bold>M</bold>A-RNase(1&#x02013;14)] and several variants bearing replacements of the linker methionine residue (residue 240 in the fusion sequence) with A, E, K, L or Q (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1</xref>). Whereas the reference construct gave rise to rods in essentially all of the cells after overnight induction of fusion protein synthesis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), the variant encoding AQAKET, which has a higher predicted amyloid-forming propensity than AMAKET, gave rise to no rod-containing cells even after induced overnight cultures were refrigerated for an additional 24 hours (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 c</xref>). Among the remaining variants, only that encoding ALAKET gave rise to rods (which formed efficiently only after refrigeration) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), suggesting that a hydrophobic residue was required at the second linker position (see below). Overall, our analysis of this set of single amino acid substitution variants suggests that rod formation is not due to the amyloid-forming propensity of the appended peptide. Conclusive evidence that the rods lack amyloid architecture follows from diffraction analysis and crystal structure determination presented below.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Crystal structures of GFP fused to eight RNase A residues.</title><p id="P12">To elucidate the intermolecular interactions that guide assembly of GFP into intracellular fluorescent rods, we crystallized a fusion protein containing RNase A residues 1&#x02013;8 [GFP-AMA-RNase(1&#x02013;8)] (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), the shortest fusion protein that efficiently formed rods. To facilitate purification of the fusion we appended a C-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag [GFP-AMA-RNase(1&#x02013;8)-His<sub>6</sub>] after determining that the tag did not alter the ability of the fusion protein to form fluorescent rods (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We discovered crystals in dozens of conditions, all of which shared the same needle morphology, recapitulating the rods observed in cells (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2a</xref>). The needles were typically over 100 &#x003bc;m long, but seldom greater than 5 &#x003bc;m thick. Among the different conditions, we discovered four different crystal forms (P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 form1, P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> form 2, C2, and P2<sub>1</sub>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2b</xref>), collected diffraction data, and solved their structures (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Remarkably, the structures obtained from the four crystal forms revealed essentially identical protofilament architectures, suggesting this architecture is likely to persist under many other conditions, including those within the cell. In each crystal form, the protofilament is assembled with 2<sub>1</sub> screw symmetry, meaning that each protomer is related to its closest neighbor protomer by a 180&#x000b0; rotation around the protofilament axis and translation along the axis by half the pitch length (i.e. rise per turn along the protofilament axis) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a and c</xref>). In each crystal form, this pitch length is approximately 51.4 &#x000c5;, (less than 1 &#x000c5; variation) and corresponds to one of the unit cell dimensions (a=51.2 &#x000c5; in P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> form 1, a=51.1 &#x000c5; in P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> form 2, b=51.3 &#x000c5; in C2, and b=51.8 &#x000c5; in P2<sub>1</sub>) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). There is no significant structural variation in protofilament architecture among crystal forms (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Indeed, the root mean square deviation is less than 0.8 &#x000c5; between protofilament segments from different crystals (composed of three consecutive GFP-AMA-RNase(1&#x02013;8)-His<sub>6</sub> protomers totaling 5667 atoms). Thus, the robust nature of this protofilament assembly is evidenced by the high degree of similarity in protofilament structures (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) despite clear differences in packing between protofilaments (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>).</p><p id="P15">A closer view of the protofilament reveals that one structural feature in particular stabilizes protofilament assembly--a new, fusion-created, C-terminal helix which fastens together neighboring pairs of protomers by binding in a groove between them (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c, and d</xref>). This new C-terminal helix comprises seventeen residues which span a sequence derived from three different origins: six residues from the natural GFP C-terminus (233-MDELYK-238), a three-residue linker (239-AMA-241), and eight residues from RNase (242-KETAAAKF-249) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The six residues contributed by GFP are normally disordered in crystal structures of natural-length GFP. The propensity of this segment to form a helix was evidently enhanced by its fusion with the RNase residues 1&#x02013;8, which also form a helix in native RNase.</p><p id="P16">The new, fusion-created helix extends up to 40 &#x000c5; away from its attachment to the barrel&#x02019;s last strand, enabling the helix to reach a binding groove that is formed by the following two protomers in the protofilament. This 40 &#x000c5; reach is thus directed by the relative positions of three successive protomers in the protofilament; the helix originates from protomer i, and the groove is formed between protomers i+1 and i+2. The ability of the helix to reach this groove is facilitated by the extended conformation adopted by GFP residues 228-GITHG-232, which connect the helix to strand 11, the last strand in the GFP barrel (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P17">Protomer i+1 forms one wall of the groove (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, brown surface). This wall comprises the surfaces of strands 3, 10, and 11 near the waist of the barrel, and the helix docks tangentially across these. The helix-in-groove interface is snug and defined almost entirely by side-chain-to-side-chain contacts. A stripe of hydrophobic side-chains (M233, L236, Y237, M240, and T244) lines the length of the &#x003b1;-helix and these embed between side-chains on the surface of the barrel (T43, K45, A206, S208, V219, and L221). Loss of this hydrophobic interface upon substituting M240 with polar, charged, or small residues, such as Q, E, K, or A, would likely explain our observation that these substitutions interfere with efficient rod formation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>). This interface between helix i and protomer i+1 buries a total of 727 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> on the two surfaces (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Protomer i+2 forms the opposite wall of the groove. This wall comprises the end of strand 5 and residues at one cap of the barrel (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, blue surface). Specifically, residues L7, P89, and F114 create a small hydrophobic pocket into which docks the side chain of A245 of the helix of protomer i. This contact is flanked on both sides by salt bridges (protomer i+2 residues E90 and D117 with helix i residues K242 and K248, respectively). This interface between protomer i+2 and helix i buries a total of 426 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> on the two surfaces (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>). Overall, the shape complementarity between the helix and groove (0.78) indicates that the fit is even tighter than typically observed among antibody-antigen complexes<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P19">Direct contact between the sides of neighboring GFP barrels strengthens and rigidifies the contiguous helix-in-groove interaction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). The interface is approximately flat. Side-chains from strands 1, 2, 5, and 6 of protomer i+1 nestle with side-chains from strands 3, 10 and 11 of protomer i+2. The interactions are primarily polar rather than non-polar. The area buried by the two surfaces of this interface is 901 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4</xref>). This patch of direct contact between barrels appears to be adventitious; it does not correspond in any way to the natural dimer interface of wild-type GFP<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">The combined surface area buried by protomers i, i+1, and i+2 appears large enough to maintain protofilament architecture in solution, free of the crystal lattice. Coordination of neighboring protomers by the C-terminal helix buries a total of 1153 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. Direct contact between protomers buries an additional 901 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of surface area. Either interface by itself would likely be insufficient to support protofilament assembly.

Specifically, we introduced a charged residue (E) in place of V219, which should disfavor the docking of M233, L236, and M240 in the C-terminal alpha helix (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3</xref>). We then induced the synthesis of GFP-AMA-RNase(1&#x02013;8)-His<sub>6</sub> with or without the V219E substitution in the GFP moiety. Whereas the unmutated fusion protein formed rod structures in essentially all of the cells after overnight induction followed by incubation for 2 hours at 4<sup>o</sup>C, the mutant fusion protein failed to form rods even after overnight cultures were refrigerated for several days, and instead gave rise to diffuse fluorescence (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5</xref>). These findings provide strong support for the hypothesis that the intermolecular interface observed in the four crystal forms is also the basis for fluorescent rod formation in bacterial cells.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>The pattern of protofilament bundling in intracellular rods resembles that observed in the C2 crystal form.</title><p id="P22">We performed <italic>in cellulo</italic> diffraction experiments to evaluate the pattern of protofilament bundling in fluorescent rods produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Moreover, the relative intensities of the six observed reflections correlate between the observed and calculated patterns, as well as the geometric disposition with respect to the meridional and equatorial directions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Structurally, we find that the Bragg planes for these six reflections coincide well with the spacings between protomers in the crystal (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6a-g</xref>). The sum of these six Fourier terms produces a low-resolution image of the protofilament in close agreement with the crystal structure (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S6h</xref>).

The purified fusion protein readily formed needle-like crystals and structure determination revealed the basis for filament formation. Specifically a fusion-created C-terminal &#x003b1;-helix extends away from the barrel to which it is attached and nestles into a groove that is formed by the barrels of two successive protomers along the protofilament axis.</p><p id="P26">This helix-in-groove linkage between protomers resembles runaway domain swapping<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>, a mechanism proposed for the assembly of disease-related fibrils. By this mechanism, each protomer swaps a part of its structure into an identical protomer along the protofilament (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). The swapped part is termed the &#x0201c;swapping domain&#x0201d; and may be as small as a single &#x003b1;-helix or &#x003b2;-strand; the receiving part is termed the &#x0201c;complementary domain&#x0201d;. The swapping event begins when a folded or &#x0201c;closed&#x0201d; monomer (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>) opens up to expose its own swapping domain to another protomer (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The flexibility required to open the monomer and execute the swap is afforded by a hinge loop that links the two domains. In GFP-RNase(1&#x02013;8) protofilaments, the C-terminal helix acts as the swapping domain, the GFP barrel acts as the complementary domain, and intervening residues 229&#x02013;232 form the hinge loop.</p><p id="P27">Other properties of the GFP-RNase filaments, such as facile nucleation and mechanical rigidity, seem incongruous with runaway domain swapping.

In some instances, the rods connect two deeply constricted cells, implying that septum formation was incapable of severing a preexisting filament (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>). In other instances, the ends of growing GFP-RNase rods appear to impose bulges at the cell poles (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). These distortions of the cell shape are reminiscent of those observed in red blood cells upon aggregation of hemoglobin bearing a single glutamate-to-valine substitution, E6V, associated with sickle cell anemia. This mutation causes hemoglobin tetramers to assemble into rigid fibrils that distort the normally disk-shaped cell to a sickle shape<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup>.

These incongruities prompted us to examine the GFP-RNase protofilament structure for attributes that differ from runaway domain swapping and facilitate nucleation and mechanical rigidity.</p><p id="P28">Consideration of the monomeric state illuminates the defining attribute that distinguishes GFP-RNase filament formation from runaway domain swapping and explains why GFP-RNase filaments grow more robustly than runaway domain swapped filaments; that is, the GFP-RNase monomer cannot competitively bind its own helical appendage. A defining feature of runaway domain swapping is the high affinity for binding the swapping domain, whether nested within its own protomer (monomeric state) or swapped into a neighboring protomer (filamentous state). The equally deep energetic stability of both the monomeric and filamentous states impedes filament nucleation and growth in two ways: (1) it imposes a large kinetic barrier to the conversion from monomer to filament because the intramolecular domain-domain interface in the monomer must be disrupted to form the equivalent intermolecular domain-domain interface in the filament<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, and (2) it renders the monomeric state an energetically viable competitor of filament nucleation and growth since the two states contain equally stabilizing domain-domain interfaces.</p><p id="P29">In violation of a defining principle of runaway domain swapping, the helix-in-groove interface that stabilizes GFP-RNase protofilaments is unattainable within individual monomers. Indeed, the C-terminal helix of GFP-RNase (donor domain) cannot bind its complementary site within the same monomer (acceptor domain) because the acceptor site is out of reach; the hinge loop is too short (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Self-complementation is further precluded by that fact that the acceptor site itself is not a single surface, but assembled from two protomers (i+1 and i+2), which respectively contribute residues from opposite faces of the barrel (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>).</p><p id="P30">The unattainability of a self-complementary donor-acceptor interface within GFP-RNase monomers explains why this protein forms filaments more readily than proteins that undergo runaway domain swapping. Without a means of self-complementation, protomers in the monomeric state cannot attain the same low energy state as do the protomers in the filament, thereby tilting the energy landscape in favor of filament growth (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f-h</xref>). The absence of stable self-complementation also has the advantage of eliminating the kinetic barrier to filament formation&#x02014;with no donor-acceptor interface in the monomer there is no barrier imposed by its disruption as there would be in runaway domain swapped filaments.</p><p id="P31">We discovered that many natural filaments display donor-acceptor linkages analogous to those observed in the GFP-RNase filaments (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). For example, in filaments of nucleocapsid protein from phlebovirus, each protomer donates a helix to an acceptor domain in the neighboring protomer<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Similarly in pilus rods of fimA protein, each protomer donates an N-terminal strand to its neighboring protomer<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, GFP-RNase, nucleocapsid protein, and fimA are all incapable of self-complementation. The mechanism of pilus rod formation has been named &#x0201c;donor-strand exchange&#x0201d;, but a more general name is needed to encompass those filaments assembled by donation of elements other than strands. We refrain from using the previously coined term &#x0201c;obligate domain swapping&#x0201d; <sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>,<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, because we have shown the mechanism is not a true domain swap. Instead, we coin the term &#x0201c;runaway domain coupling&#x0201d; to describe all filaments like GFP-RNase in which protomers interface through distinct donor and acceptor domains--interfaces which are unattainable in individual monomers.</p><p id="P32">Runaway domain coupling describes many protofilament assemblies, but it does not explain why some, like GFP-RNase, are mechanically rigid. Indeed, a flexible linker is characteristic of this mechanism. Rigidity, on the other hand, is a defining characteristic of domain stacking, in which copies of a single rigid domain stack together in uninterrupted succession (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In GFP-RNase protofilaments, protomers stack through patches on the rigid barrel domains, thus rigidifying the otherwise flexible domain coupled linkages (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2f</xref>). This combination of domain coupling and stacking is also evident in naturally occurring RecA nucleoprotein filaments; even in the absence of nucleic acid, RecA forms filaments with a persistence length of about 100 nm (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>)(<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. In contrast, the runaway domain coupled filaments of phlebovirus nucleocapsid protein have no supplementary connection through domain stacking (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). Accordingly, the filaments give the appearance of a random walk in electron micrographs<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. Hence, domain stacking imparts rigidity to a protofilaments, acting alone or in combination with other mechanisms.</p><p id="P33">Bridging is yet another mechanism of filament formation that contributes to the mechanical rigidity of GFP-RNase protofilaments. Bridging interfaces join nonconsecutive protomers in the protofilament, creating a mutually supportive closed network that includes the intervening &#x0201c;bridged&#x0201d; protomer(s) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>). In GFP-RNase protofilaments, a bridging interface exists between protomers i and i+2, as part of the helix-in-groove interaction (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4k</xref>). This interface in turn, bolsters contacts between these protomers and the intervening protomer i+1. Bridging is also observed in tropomyosin, which forms a coiled coil bridge across protomers in actin filaments<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>, thereby reinforcing stacking between actin domains and increasing the persistence length by two-fold (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Bridging also helps assemble soluble E6V hemolgobin tetramers into cell-deforming rods<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and tubulin protofilaments into microtubules. Cooperativity is implied by bridging because assembly of two protomers enhances binding of a third protomer.</p><p id="P34">Genesis of protofilaments by either runaway domain coupling or domain stacking appears relatively difficult to achieve through a single, <italic>de novo</italic> interface alone. The interface would have to be sufficiently large<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and snug for the protofilament to have a significant lifetime, presumably requiring many iterations of genetic selection. Circular permutation may offer a shortcut by exploiting a preexisting intramolecular interface. For example, circular permutation may shift an N-terminal element to the C-terminus. From its new location, the element may not reach its own complementary site near the N-terminus, but it might easily reach the complementary site of another protomer&#x02014;a perfect setup for runaway domain coupling (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S7</xref>). Circular permutation occurs with sufficient frequency in nature to be a plausible step in protofilament genesis; according to one study, as many as 47% of all domains examined have a circularly permuted homolog<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Simpler still, runaway domain coupled protofilaments might also arise from insertion of a stop codon in a multi-domain oligomeric protein, as engineered in the T7 primase-helicase gene<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. Evidently, the removal of some structural elements disrupted cyclic oligomerization in favor of a runaway polymerization.</p><p id="P35">Surprisingly, protofilaments might be generated faster when protomer-protomer interfaces are divided over multiple surfaces, as observed in GFP-RNase protofilaments (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4k</xref>), rather than collected in a single surface. Contrary to the elevated level of complexity inferred by the presence of three distinct interfaces in GFP-RNase protofilaments (runaway domain coupling, stacking, and bridging), this combination allows each of the interfaces to be relatively smaller, and therefore relatively easier to achieve. In fact, we found that a majority of crystal structures of monomeric proteins demonstrate intermolecular interfaces as large as the individual interfaces observed in GFP-RNase protofilaments (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Note 2</xref>).</p><p id="P36">Flexible linkage between domains, such as occurs in runaway domain coupling, seems advantageous for consolidating these smaller interfaces into a network stable enough to support filament genesis. Consider an early stage of protofilament evolution in which domains can stack, but the stacking interface is too small to be stable. Suppose that this stacking domain is linked to an accessory domain with the potential to evolve a second, stabilizing interface in parallel with the first. If the linker between domains is rigid, only a small portion of the accessory domain may be in proximity of establishing a new interface without disturbing the first. However, if the linker is flexible, as is the case with domain coupling, additional residues may be brought in proximity, improving chances of encountering a snug interface. Indeed, one third of all the naturally occurring filament structures we surveyed involve combinations of runaway domain coupling with stacking (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). Notably, runaway domain coupling, stacking, and bridging were revealed recently in CTP synthase<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, a representative of a class of metabolic enzymes that evolved filamentation as a survival response to certain cellular conditions<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P37">The advantage of flexibility for consolidating stacking interfaces comes with an entropic penalty--the immobilization of the interdomain loop. This penalty partially diminishes the stability of the protofilament, perhaps explaining the temperature sensitivity of filament formation by some of the GFP-RNase constructs (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, c</xref>) and the sensitivity of CTP synthase filamentation to cellular conditions. These two filaments also score lower values of interface area and solvation free energy than the majority of naturally occurring filaments (<xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S8</xref>), suggesting another reason for their sensitivity.</p><p id="P38">A strategy of combining runaway domain coupling with stacking may offer new advantages for filament design.

In all these cases, alignment between protomers was designed computationally, thereby eliminating the need for flexibility to attain alignment. However, the success of most of these designs depended on the presence of a naturally evolved dimerization interface. We propose that a design strategy of combining runaway domain coupling with stacking could open up filamentation to the majority of monomeric proteins, employing interfaces as small as the average crystal packing interface.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Online Methods</title><sec id="S10"><title>Plasmids, Strains, and Cell Growth.</title><p id="P39">GFP fusions were produced from pBR322-derived plasmids under the control of the arabinose-inducible promoter pBAD.

Then, we applied crystallographic screw operations to the reference molecules, allowing for up to 3 unit cell translations in any combination along positive and negative a, b, and c. Screw operators were accepted as potential protofilament generators only if the reference molecule and the operated molecule were close enough to touch. We defined touching distance as any distance less than twice the distance of the furthest atom of the reference molecule from its center of mass. These criteria produced 73,968 screw-related pairs. Surface areas buried by these interfaces were calculated using the CCP4 program, areaimol<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Of these, 26,375 screw-related pairs meet the criterion of a quasi-stable interface as defined by equaling or surpassing the 901 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> of buried surface area (450 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> per surface) observed between barrel domains of our GFP fusion protein protofilament. That is, 9119 PDB entries, or 74% of the monomer entries. Including a constraint that one of the termini be located within 12 &#x000c5; of the intermolecular interface (a threshold defined by our GFP fusion protein) leaves 53% of monomeric PDB entries meeting these combined criteria. That is, over half the monomer entries in the PDB (6816 entries) are poised for filament formation.</p></sec><sec id="S23"><title>Simulation of helix-forming propensity for randomly generated 13-mers.</title><p id="P53">We used a random number generator and probability weighted amino acid frequencies in vertebrates to calculate one million peptide sequences.

Hinge loops, which link the domains, confer flexibility to the filament. Nucleation usually requires lengthy or harsh conditions because the closed, self-complemented state (<bold>c</bold>) is far more stable than the open state (<bold>d</bold>) in which the swapping element (in this case indicated by a bumpy rectangle) is exposed and the complementing surface (indicated by a cavity) is available for swapping. (<bold>f-h</bold>) Protofilament assembly through runaway domain coupling features a similar exchange of domains between protomers, but is more easily achieved because the donor domain is permanently open (<bold>g</bold>), geometrically restricted from self-complementing (for example, by a hinge loop that is too short). Thus no closed monomer exists (<bold>f</bold>) to compete for protofilament assembly. (<bold>i-k</bold>)Combinations of stacking, bridging, and coupling elements are commonly observed. For example, stacking, bridging and coupling elements are consolidated in the GFP fusion (<bold>j-k</bold>). In this case, the complementation site is divided over two surfaces (<bold>j</bold>). That is, two (or more) protomers cooperate to complement the swapping domain (<bold>k</bold>), rather than just one (<bold>h</bold>). Cooperativity implies a larger entropic barrier to nucleation because the nucleus is composed of more protomers, but this limit may be offset by the absence of closed monomer to compete for protofilament assembly. Conceivably, stacking, bridging, and swapping could also coexist if the complementation site resided entirely within protomer i+2.</p></caption><graphic
