It has gained significant popularity among younger-generation tobacco smokers due to its advertisement as a non-toxic inhalation property and a potential smoking-cessation aid. The US&#x000a0;Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x000a0;has been regulating e-cigarettes as tobacco products and not as drug-delivery devices, as many medical experts think it should be categorized. In the last few years, the medical community has encountered increasing episodes of burn injuries secondary to e-cigarette battery explosion. Explosions occur through a process known as a "thermal runaway.&#x0201d;&#x000a0;This process occurs when the battery overheats&#x000a0;and the internal battery temperature increases dangerously high, to the point of inner fire and explosion. Overcharge, puncture, external heat, short circuit, amongst others, are conditions that cause a &#x0201c;thermal runaway.&#x0201d;</p><p>This is a retrospective review and analysis of six patients with superficial, partial, and full-thickness burn injuries related to e-cigarette battery explosions managed at Johns Hopkins Bayview Burn Center over the course of one year. Lund-Browder diagrams and calculations were used to assess the total body surface area (TBSA) burns.

Five patients were discharged home within a week, including the patient who required operative excision and auto-grafting.

Unlike traditional cigarettes, there is no burning of tobacco leaves that occurs or tar produced. Typically, smokers use nicotine, cannabis, hash, or other simple flavor vapors. It is commonly referred to as &#x0201c;vaping,&#x0201d;&#x000a0;in contrast to smoking, because combustion does not occur. Commercialization has produced many different models with various shapes that differ on how much nicotine can be released with each inhalation.</p><p>Many resemble traditional cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, and prices for e-cigarettes range from $30 to $300. In 2007, e-cigarettes became available for sale on the United States market and since then, their use has grown among smokers [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].&#x000a0;One of the main reasons for its current popularity is the perception of consumers that vaping is healthier than smoking traditional cigarettes [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since initial commercialization, companies have advertised the absence of inhaled carcinogenic substances and combustion when compared to regular cigarettes. Some companies have even promoted e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid.</p><p>However, there is insufficient data to deny or support long-term health effects [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, in many countries, government regulators are unsure how to classify these relatively new devices. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x000a0;has been regulating e-cigarettes as tobacco products and not as drug-delivery devices, as many medical experts think it should be categorized [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In the last few years, the medical community has encountered increasing episodes of burn injuries secondary to e-cigarette battery explosions [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although battery failure and explosion have been well-documented in different lithium batteries, including cellphones and laptop computers, e-cigarette batteries seem more prone to failure due to an inherent weakness in their structural design. The cylindrical shape of many of these batteries creates a weak point on the ends where the battery&#x02019;s seal is placed after filling it with electrolyte. Lithium batteries are typically composed of four elements: a negative electrode or an anode (made of copper and carbon material); a positive electrode or a cathode (made of aluminum and lithium-ion); an electrolyte, such as a lithium salt (LiPF, LiBF, or LiCIO); an organic solvent (ethylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, or diethyl carbonate), and a porous plastic membrane separator.</p><p>Thermal runaway, or the overheating of the battery, is the process by which the internal battery temperature increases to the point where an internal fire or explosion can be started by conditions such as overcharge, puncture, external heat, a short circuit, etc.</p></sec><sec sec-type="cases"><title>Case presentation</title><p>Sequence of a typical failure</p><p>The electrolyte overheats -&#x0003e; Increased internal pressure -&#x0003e; Breakage of the sealed end -&#x0003e; Electrolyte&#x000a0;ignites -&#x0003e; Creates gas expansion -&#x0003e; Increased internal pressure -&#x0003e; Combustion of the porous plastic separator film (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG1">1</xref>).</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="FIG1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Sequence of a typical failure: &#x0201c;thermal runaway.&#x0201d;</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="cureus-0011-00000005355-i01"/></fig><p>While most of these failures and explosions have occurred while charging the lithium battery, several have occurred when a person has been carrying the device and/or battery in a pocket or even when using the device [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG2">2b</xref>).&#x000a0;Most of these burns are caused by a combined mechanism of flame and chemical burn.

Further studies are required to support the long-term health benefits. Additionally, many regulators are unsure how to classify these relatively new devices and what the standards should be in the manufacture as well as quality control.</p><p>Even though lithium battery failures and instability are rare events, they have been well-documented in different devices. The particular build-shape of the e-cigarette battery seems to make them particular susceptible to this kind of failure and thermal runaway [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In the last few years, the medical community has encountered increasing episodes of burn injuries secondary to e-cigarette battery explosion that has been reflected by the media and news. However, there are no clear published guidelines for managing lithium battery burns. In our series, we were able to manage the majority of our patient&#x02019;s injuries at the bedside, with varying combinations of mechanical/chemical debridement as well as topical wound care.&#x000a0;Only one of our six patients required tangential excision and skin grafting. The rest of our patients were treated conservatively with complex wound care with excellent responses.</p><p>Previous case reports in the literature have pointed out that these burns are a combination of a flame burn with some component of chemical burn due to residual elemental lithium reacting with water by producing alkali lithium hydroxide and hydrogen gas [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, our patients did not show exacerbation of their symptoms after debridement and irrigation with sterile water.</p><p>Although not always necessary, Laser Doppler imaging can be a useful adjuvant tool for indeterminate burn wounds. The clinical exam is, unfortunately, only accurate in about two-thirds of cases when determining burn depth in partial-thickness burns [<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It has been well-established that LDI predicts healing time for wounds with a very high degree of accuracy (95%-100%)&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our patient&#x02019;s case, LDI aided us in determining whether or not his wounds would heal or would necessitate surgical debridement of the wound. Since the results of LDI suggested that the wound had good healing potential, we felt that the patient&#x02019;s wishes to forego any surgical debridement were acceptable and would not hinder his wound healing/recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As e-cigarette use is climbing in the general population, clinicians need to attune themselves to the presentation and management of these injuries. As presented in this case series, there is a spectrum of treatment choices and therapy should be tailored to each individual patient. The majority of our patients were managed with local wound care and without the need for procedural intervention. LDI is a useful tool in guiding clinical judgment when it is difficult to assess the burn wound depth based solely off of clinical exam.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group
