    "Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their low cost, fast ionic conductivity in electrolyte, and high operating voltage. Research on PIBs is still in its infancy, however, and achieving a general understanding of the drawbacks of each component and proposing research strategies for overcoming these problems are crucial for the exploration of suitable electrode materials/electrolytes and the establishment of electrode/cell assembly technologies for further development of PIBs. In this review, we summarize our current understanding in this field, classify and highlight the design strategies for addressing the key issues in the research on PIBs, and propose possible pathways for the future development of PIBs toward practical applications. The strategies and perspectives summarized in this review aim to provide practical guidance for an increasing number of researchers to explore next-generation and high-performance PIBs, and the methodology may also be applicable to developing other energy storage systems."
