a number of serious incidents
in the past; they are prone to reaction runaways because of their
exothermic and autoaccelerating nature. To minimalize the risk, the
reaction is commonly performed in a solvent as empirical industrial
practice. In this work, the thermal runaway hazards of the ethylbenzene&#x02013;styrene
system with different monomer mass fractions were calorimetrically
investigated up to temperatures where decomposition products are unlikely
to be produced. Experiments showed that the polymerization runaway
&#x0201c;onset&#x0201d; temperature inversely increased with the monomer
mass fraction. Experiment and thermodynamic calculations showed that
volatile diluent increased system vapor pressure even at a lower adiabatic
temperature rise and verified that moderation of the risks could be
achieved if the monomer mass fraction is below ca. 85%. A lumped kinetic
model developed by Hui and Hamielec was used to predict the runaway
profile of this reaction under different dilutions, and the agreement
was excellent.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao9b00004</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao-2019-00004y</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Styrene is one of the
most widely used monomers and has a variety
of applications in the chemical industry to produce polystyrene, acrylonitrile&#x02013;butadiene&#x02013;styrene
rubber, and many other polymers. However, the storage and polymerization
processes are prone to runaways as monomers are thermally unstable.
Barton and Nolan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> reported that 48% of
total runaway incidents that occurred over the period from 1962 to
1987 in the UK were polymerization reactions. A reactive chemical
incidents report published by the Chemical Safety Board (CSB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> also denoted that almost 15% of incidents involving
uncontrolled chemical reactions in 1980&#x02013;2001 in the US are
polymerization thermal runaways. An incident statistical study by
Sales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> in 2006 showed that 17 out of 132
(13%) reactive chemical incidents recorded by the major accident reporting
system in the European Commission were caused by the polymerization
runaway reactions. More recently, Mihailidou<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> analyzed 319 major industrial incidents with significant consequences
based on the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) criterion and
found 34 out of 319 (11%) major incidents worldwide during the years
1917&#x02013;2011 were related to the reactive monomer/polymer process.
Saada<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> analyzed 30 runaway incidents in
a specific unit process during 1988&#x02013;2013 and showed that over
33% of those were polymerization incidents. A significant number of
these incidents were related to styrene production and handling as

styrene handling
and polystyrene production process. First of all, the styrene polymerization
reaction is relatively highly exothermic with a heat generation at
around 71 kJ&#x000b7;mol<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> At the same time, even without an initiator, two styrene molecules
will undergo a Diels&#x02013;Alder type of reaction and generate radicals
to start self-polymerization upon heating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> This polymerization process auto-accelerates as the reaction progresses;
the system viscosity dramatically increases, and the reaction becomes
diffusion-controlled, which is known as the gel effect or Trommsdorff&#x02013;Norrish
effect. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref> gives
a schematic of how the gel effect might lead to the thermal runaway
for polymerization.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Gel effect in the polymerization system.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ao-2019-00004y_0001" id="gr1" position="float"/></fig><p>From a classic first-principle kinetic analysis,
the polymerization
rate <italic>R</italic><sub>p</sub> is proportional related to the
propagation rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>p</sub>, monomer
concentration, and also to the square root of the initiator efficiency <italic>f</italic>, the initiator decomposition rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>d</sub>, and the reciprocal of the termination rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub>. As the monomers are consumed, the polymer
concentration as well as polymer molecular weight <italic>M</italic> increases, and the latter can increase by orders of magnitudes compared
with monomer molar weight. These long-chain polymers significantly
elevate system viscosity via two different mechanisms. First of all,
the intrinsic viscosity of polymer chains [&#x003b7;] increases exponentially
with molecular weight <italic>M</italic> because of the increase of
the length of polymer chains, which can be described by the Mark&#x02013;Houwink
as <xref rid="eq2" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq2" ref-type="disp-formula">6</xref></xref>. Parameters <italic>a</italic> and <italic>K</italic> depend on the specific polymer&#x02013;solvent
system. At the same time, bulk viscosity of the solution increases
with polymer concentration, as formulated by Huggins in <xref rid="eq3" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq3" ref-type="disp-formula">7</xref></xref>, where &#x003b7;<sub>sp</sub> is
the specific viscosity, &#x003b7;<sub>0</sub> is the solvent viscosity,
and <italic>k</italic><sub>H</sub> is the Huggins coefficient. Thus,
the mobility of polymer chains and diffusion is strongly hindered
such that the termination rate dramatically drops compared with the
initial termination rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>t</sub><sup arrange="stack">0</sup> according to <xref rid="eq4" ref-type="disp-formula">eq <xref rid="eq4" ref-type="disp-formula">8</xref></xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> resulting
in a fasterned polymerization reaction rate. This synergetic process
could be further intensified under adiabatic conditions, as reaction
heat generated during exotherm elevates the system temperature and
reaction rate. To ease the gel effect and avoid sudden increase of
viscosity and heat release, the industry employs a small portion of
the organic solvent to reduce the system viscosity and enhance the
mobility of polymer chains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> A cascade
of tower-type reactors is also employed to limit the reaction extent
and viscosity increase.</p><p>It is of great importance that such
a highly hazardous reaction
process should be carried out in compliance with the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 29 CFR 1910.119, process safety
management (PSM) of highly hazardous chemicals standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> Among the 14 elements included in the PSM, process
hazard analysis is essential in terms of identifying, evaluating,
and controlling the hazard of the process. For reactive chemical systems
in general, calorimeter studies provide valuable process safety data
such as &#x0201c;onset&#x0201d; temperature of exothermic reactions,
maximum temperature, maximum pressure, and noncondensable gas generation
under intended or unintended (mal-operation) conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> These data would serve as the basis for designing
the process itself, its protection layers, and methods to control
reaction hazards, for example, cooling capacity design and relief
valve sizing.</p><p>A considerable amount of the literature has been
published on the
assessment of the thermal hazards of the undesirable thermally initiated
styrene polymerization using calorimeters. Whiting and Tou<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> evaluated the thermal behavior of inhibited
styrene in an accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) to address the effects
of the system thermal inertia. Gibson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> tested the runaway reaction of inhibited styrene starting from 150
&#x000b0;C in an adiabatic Dewar and calculated the relief valve size.
Frurip et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> discussed some general
practices regarding hazard evaluation of polymerizable compounds and
performed the ARC test on uninhibited styrene with peroxide at various
concentrations. Chen et al. performed isothermal studies on inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> and uninhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> styrene
to investigate the runaway behavior and kinetic parameters of styrene
at low temperatures using microcalorimeters. Leung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> utilized the ARC to investigate the thermally
initiated polymerization of inhibited styrene with 20% ethylbenzene
added to the system.</p><p>A thorough literature review revealed that
very few studies focused
on the diluted styrene-solution system, which is more commonly employed
in industrial practices, and the reaction hazards accruing from this
system were not fully understood. From the inherent safer design (ISD)
point of view,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup> the addition of solvent
into the system is an effective &#x0201c;moderating&#x0201d; strategy
because it lowers system viscosity and the reaction runaway severity
as can be shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>. At the same time, this moderating measure contradicts the
&#x0201c;substituting&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;simplifying&#x0201d; principles
of ISD by introducing an additional volatile and highly flammable
species into the system. The system complexity also increases as one
more component is involved, inevitably affecting the physical properties
of the system and in particular the ones which are directly related
with its safety (e.g., flash point, flammable limit, heat capacity,
vapor pressure, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity). Furthermore,
additional hazardous scenarios have to be introduced as the interaction
between the solvent and styrene needs to be considered.</p><p>For
a pure styrene calorimetry study, the most well-studied scenario
was the worst-case runaway reaction, where the system cooling was
lost and the reaction developed under adiabatic condition. For a binary
solvent-styrene system, another possible scenario is that the solvent-to-monomer
ratio deviates from the original design intent. By applying the hazard
and operability study concept to this solvent-styrene system, the
reaction recipe is chosen as the study node, with monomer mass fraction
as the process parameter, and the deviations (guide words) are &#x0201c;high&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;low&#x0201d;, which adequately represent two types of mischarging
scenarios. The quantification of the consequences of these scenarios
provides useful information on how monomer fraction will affect runaway
behavior and process hazards.</p><p>In this paper, the runaway hazards
of the polymerization of uninhibited
styrene in ethylbenzene were evaluated as a function of the monomer
mass fraction in screening and adiabatic calorimeters to obtain quantitative
reaction hazard information. A lumped kinetic modeling was employed
to simulate the temperature and pressure profile, and the global rate
of the thermal polymerization was evaluated to obtain critical reaction
parameters for predicting runaway behavior.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials

ReagentPlus, 99%) and alumina inhibitor remover (Sigma-Aldrich) were
used without further purification. Styrene (Sigma-Aldrich, ReagentPlus,

as an inhibitor; this inhibitor requires dissolved oxygen to become
effective. To rule out the retardant effect of inhibitor, TBC was

rate of 4 K&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. To prevent sample boiling,
high-pressure (15 MPa) stainless steel capsules were used for all
tests. The measured heat flow was divided by the mass of the reactant
to obtain the specific heat flow; then, the specific heat flow was
integrated with respect to test time to get the specific heat of the
sample. The specific heat of reaction of styrene monomer for styrene&#x02013;ethylbenzene
samples was calculated by dividing the heat of reaction of the entire

were obtained by rescanning the sample after each test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Automatic Pressure Tracking Adiabatic Calorimeter</title><p>A
DSC study only gives heat generation information for small sample
quantities. The obtained data are not enough to adequately assess
the thermal hazards of reaction at industrial scales under worst-case
scenarios; only to flag severe thermal hazards. Furthermore, it is
also not possible to obtain pressure-rise information during the runaway
with DSC. In a thermal runaway incident, it is the pressure which
rises, as the temperature increases, driving to potential rupture
of the confined container or its explosion, loss of containment and
potential domino effects such as fire. Adiabatic calorimeter tests
have been proven to be extremely important for a more reliable evaluation
of thermal hazards of reactive chemicals in bulk quantities under
various conditions. The automatic pressure tracking adiabatic calorimeter
(APTAC) enables the use of a relatively large sample size and maintains
the reactant at near adiabatic conditions by keeping the temperature/pressure
difference in and out of the test cell minimal.</p><p>In this work,
ca. 10 g of the sample was loaded into a glass test-cell of a thermal
inertia factor (&#x003c6;-factor) of 1.25&#x02013;1.26. To eliminate
the dissolved oxygen, the sample was purged with nitrogen for 30 min
in an ice bath before being tested. Styrene polymerization generates
only condensable gases and has been identified as a vapor system by
the Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS) regarding relief valve
design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> To suppress the boiling of the
solution and minimalize the tempering effects, the APTAC cell, together
with the contained reactant, was pressurized with nitrogen to around
1000 kPa (147 psi) before heating. A heat&#x02013;wait&#x02013;search
operating mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> was applied with temperature
steps of 5 &#x000b0;C, a heating rate of 5 &#x000b0;C&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, and a 30 min waiting period between temperature steps. APTAC entered
adiabatic mode once the self-heating rate exceeded 0.1 &#x000b0;C&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Temperature and pressure, as well as the rate of
self-heating and pressure-rise, was measured and recorded throughout

and inhibitor-free styrene was first tested in DSC to
check the effect of TBC on styrene thermally initiated self-polymerization
reaction. The specific heat flow is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, and the characteristic thermal hazards
information obtained from repeated trails are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref>. As can be seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>, three exothermic
peaks were displayed in both cases. However, the time of their appearance
and the heat flow generated are significantly different. For TBC inhibited
styrene, the first exothermic peak was detected to be around 150 &#x000b0;C,
followed by a higher peak at 205 &#x000b0;C and an almost invisible one
at around 250 &#x000b0;C. This multipeak exothermic curve denoted a complex
reaction pathway of thermal polymerization of styrene and had been
observed in many other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> Liao<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup> reported similar peak behavior for TBC inhibited styrene
and performed kinetic modeling on each peak. It was identified that
the first peak was typical of an autocatalytic behavior while the
second peak was an <italic>n</italic>th order regarding styrene with
a reaction order around 1.8&#x02013;2. For inhibitor-free samples,
the DSC curve showed a different thermal profile as three major exothermic
peaks appeared at 120, 150, and 205 &#x000b0;C. As can be seen, the overall
heat generation was approximately the same for both cases. However,
in the case of the uninhibited monomer, the reaction became notable
at a much lower temperature (101 &#x000b0;C) while its rate of heat generation
was much slower than that of the inhibited monomer. Also, the temperature
range of the exothermic reaction was expanded. It is argued that thermally
initiated radicals trigger the polymerization at a much lower temperature,
which can be considered as a guiding value for deciding on styrene
storage conditions in view of inhibitor depletion. When the TBC or
other inhibitors are exhausted over time in a styrene tank, the self-reaction
may significantly accelerate at around 101 &#x000b0;C. On the other hand,
if unwanted polymerization occurs in an inhibited quantity of styrene,
containment of the unwanted reaction may not be possible as the generation
of heat will be more intense after 150 &#x000b0;C compared with uninhibited
styrene. The maximum heat flow for either sample was detected at 205
&#x000b0;C, and this unaltered characteristic temperature indicated that
15 ppm of TBC effectively inhibited self-polymerization but only at
the early stage. It is plausible that the first peak denotes the primary
radical production, where the TBC acts as a radical scavenger and
thus delays the polymerization until it is depleted at a higher temperature.
The main peak is likely to represent the main polymerization process
in the course of which the monomers add up to build the extended polymer
chain. The heat of polymerization of styrene obtained from this study
was between 629&#x02013;646 J&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, which is
slightly lower than the value of 670 &#x000b1; 11 J&#x000b7;g<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> measured by Chen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> using 10 mg of styrene.
This deviation may be owed to the more heat dissipation to the surrounding
caused by the smaller sample size in this study.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Dynamic DSC measurements

of reaction was calculated as described in the experimental section
and summarized in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref> as &#x00394;<italic>H</italic> of the solution. The heat of reaction
of the samples was the total heat released by the samples. This value
is useful for the calculation of the cooling system for the polymerization.
The monotonically decreasing heat release indicated that addition
of the solvent significantly reduced the overall thermal hazards.
The heat flow was then divided by the styrene mass fraction to produce <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b, and the overall
reaction heat of styrene is reported as &#x00394;<italic>H</italic> of
styrene in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">3</xref></xref>.
Three major exothermic peaks for all polymerization reactions irrespectively
of styrene concentrations were obtained. As can be seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b, in all cases,
the first two peaks had approximately the same position and area.
In other words, the same amount of heat was produced by styrene, regardless
of ethylbenzene addition up to around 150 &#x000b0;C. This observation
led to the hypothesis that the thermally initiated polymerization
process of styrene was not affected by the addition of solvent at
the initial stage (before around 150 &#x000b0;C). The last exothermic
peak shifted from 205 to 210 &#x000b0;C as styrene mass fraction in the
solution was reduced from 100 to 55%. In addition to that, the respective
peak became wider as the solvent increased; the severity of the reaction
step was decreased as the specific heat released in each case was
declining (smaller peak area) with a lower monomer mass fraction.
This is a clear indication that the final peak corresponds to chain-addition/termination
course, a process which has been known to be strongly affected by
the gel effect.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>DSC results of thermal polymerization of styrene in ethylbenzene

When the mass fraction of styrene in the test sample was lowered,
the collisions between active reactant species were significantly
reduced, resulting in a slower chain addition process. At the same
time, in the more diluted solution, the mobility of the polymer chains
was increased which facilitated the termination process, thus resulting
in reduced chain length and therefore reduced reaction severity. Therefore,
the DSC results confirmed that when the reaction takes place in a
dilute solution, it becomes significantly less thermally hazardous
because of the reduced heat generated. However, as this is partially
owed to the shorter polymer chains production, product quality standards
also need to be considered so that the objective of performing the
polymerization is not compromised.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><label>3.3</label><title>APTAC

the detected adiabatic &#x0201c;onset&#x0201d;
temperature was 106 &#x000b0;C, denoting that the polymerization reaction
started to have a self-heating rate higher than 0.1 &#x000b0;C&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>. Soon after the &#x0201c;onset&#x0201d;, a steep increase
in temperature was observed starting at 100 min of the reaction, resulting
in a temperature increment of 200 &#x000b0;C within 15 min. Such rapid,
explosive-like reaction behavior indicates the severity of uncontrolled
thermal polymerization of pure styrene. Correspondingly, the pressure
inside the test cell increased by 1300 kPa (189 psi), indicating how
severe threat to process vessels and relief valves a runaway can pose.
These data also explain why it is a common practice in the industry
to avoid using 100% pure styrene for polymer production. The maximum
temperature obtained was about 20 &#x000b0;C below the decomposition
&#x0201c;onset&#x0201d; temperature of polystyrene in nitrogen as obtained
by Peterson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> indicating that no decomposition
was initiated by the runaway reaction.</p><p>From the temperature
data, it is clear that as the monomer mass
fraction decreased, heat generated by the reaction dissipated to the
solvent, and a significant delay and mitigation of thermal polymerization
was observed. The adiabatic &#x0201c;onset&#x0201d; temperature increased
to 126 &#x000b0;C for 55% styrene. This is a clear indication that the
solvent will &#x0201c;delay&#x0201d; a potential runaway such that the
same self-heating rate was achieved at a much higher temperature for
diluted samples. However, at the same time, from a scientific point
of view, this research demonstrates the misleading role that the &#x0201c;onset&#x0201d;
temperature can play if it is considered as a &#x0201c;physical property&#x0201d;
of the reactant. What actually these measurements indicate is that
the enhanced transfer of heat of reaction because of the dilution
of the monomer substantially delays the reaction runaway.</p><p>Additionally,
the adiabatic temperature rise dropped from 290 to
104 &#x000b0;C, which was almost 1/3 of the value for pure styrene when
the mass fraction was reduced to 55%. Unsurprisingly, the time for
the reaction to reach its summit increased as the styrene mass fraction
dropped. For all samples, the main exothermic activity was observed
after 100 min. For pure styrene, it took only 121 min for the adiabatic
reaction to reach its maximum speed. As the mass content dropped,
a longer time was required for the polymerization to develop fully,
and the TMR prolonged. The 55% styrene&#x02013;ethylbenzene system
took almost 3 h to reach its maximum heat release rate. It is clear
that the pure styrene system brings difficulties to hazard mitigation
or emergency responding, and adding solvents is a practical solution
to mitigate the sudden temperature increase. In the case of a loss-of-cooling
scenario, systems with longer TMR have a lower risk of catastrophic
consequences as more time is available to respond and implement mitigation
measures.</p><p>However, the effect of styrene concentration on pressure
change
was not as straightforward as temperature. All experiments had approximately
the same initial pad pressure of 1000 kPa (147 psi) but their &#x0201c;onset&#x0201d;
temperatures were different, leading to a slight variation on the
&#x0201c;onset&#x0201d; pressure. The peak pressure and pressure difference
did not change monotonically with the mass content. When styrene was
diluted from 100 to 85%, a higher pressure building up was observed.
The pressure changes then declined upon further ethylbenzene addition.
As there was no noncondensable gas production during this reaction,
the pressure increases primarily consisted of two parts: (1) the vapor
pressure of volatile components, which is also a function of temperature
and (2) the expansion of pad gas at higher temperature practically
obeying the gas law. For the polymer mixture system, the former one
was also affected by the polymers produced. According to Flory&#x02019;s
free volume theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> the vapor pressure
of polymer itself is usually omitted, but the polymer chains had significant
effects on the activity of solvent and monomer, leading to a change
of vapor pressure of these volatile species. In this study, a pure
styrene system had the highest temperature increase, leading to a
higher expansion of nitrogen pad. At the same time, as no solvent
was present, monomers reacted to form a nonvolatile polymer, which
contributed very little to the total pressure. The pressure trajectory
denoted that the system pressure reached its maximum before the end
of the adiabatic reaction, and gradually decreased afterward. Similar
pressure behavior was also observed by Gibson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> in Dewar bottle and Tou<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> in the ARC,
where the maximum pressure during the runaway reaction of styrene
was significantly higher than the final pressure. The experimental
data reinforced the speculation that monomer vapor pressure contribution
first increases and then decreases during the reaction.</p><p>For
the 85% styrene&#x02013;ethylbenzene system, the lower temperature
increment resulted in a less-expanded nitrogen pad. However, the ethylbenzene
was not consumed during the reaction and then contributed to building
up vapor pressure. The summation of these two factors led to an overall
higher pressure (2400 kPa) than the pure system (2200 kPa). It is
worth mentioning that this higher pressure was observed at a lower
temperature (298 &#x000b0;C) compared with that of the pure styrene (335
&#x000b0;C). If this maximum pressure was normalized to 335 &#x000b0;C,
then the potential pressure rise could increase further to around
2562 kPa, which was also denoted in the figure. As more solvent was
added, the reaction extent and temperature increase were lowered,
even though more solvent vaporized at a lower temperature, and the
expansion of pad gas was not significant, resulting in a lowered total
pressure increase. From a safety perspective, the real hazard of a
runaway reaction is the uncontrolled pressure, as the direct cause
of the loss of containment is the overpressure. Toxic or flammable
reactants may be released when the pressure build up exceeds the ultimate
strength of the process vessel, followed by fire or explosion. Although
diluting the monomer by 15% helps lower heat release, the elevated
pressure change may pose another concern of possible loss of containment.</p><p>These key hazard indicators obtained from adiabatic tests were

change of nitrogen was assumed to follow the ideal
gas law, while the gas-phase temperature increased during exotherm,
and the headspace volume expanded because of the contraction of the
liquid phase caused by polymerization. In such a way, each pressure
contributor was simulated separately, as shown in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref></xref>.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Hui and Hamielec kinetic

that the maximum pressure during
the adiabatic thermal runaway was not a monotonic function of the
monomer mass fraction, which was confirmed by the experiments. It
was expected that as the reaction temperature increased during the
adiabatic runaway polymerization, the pad gas expansion would result
in a respective rise of pressure. However, as the monomer with lower
density gradually reacted to build up polymer chains with higher density,
a contraction of the liquid phase and an expansion of the gas phase
was introduced. This volume change counterbalanced the temperature
change effect and moderated the pad-pressure increase. The vapor pressure
of monomer and ethylbenzene increased with temperature, while at the
same time the monomer was consumed and thus its contribution to the
total vapor pressure during the reaction decreased.</p><p>When the
mass fraction of monomer increased from 55 to 100%, the
nonreactive volatile components fractions dropped, and the total pressure
increase with conversion showed a significant change. Two different
pressure change patterns were observed as shown in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Hui and Hamielec kinetic

fraction below 95%, the calculated
maximum pressure was observed at the end of the reaction (<italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> = <italic>P</italic><sub>final</sub>). In
these cases, although the monomer was completely consumed at the final
stage, the solvent vapor pressure reached its maximum and had a significant
contribution to the total pressure. The simulations for a styrene
mass fraction of 95 and 100% showed that the total pressure first
increased with conversion and then dropped at the end of the reaction
(<italic>P</italic><sub>max</sub> &#x0003e; <italic>P</italic><sub>final</sub>). In other words, the peak thermal hazard and peak pressure hazard
appeared at different stages of the adiabatic runaway reaction. For
the pure styrene sample, simulation denoted peak pressure value was
at around 77% monomer conversion, at which point 23% of the monomer
still had a significant contribution to the total pressure. After
more monomers were consumed, the simulated vapor pressure of monomer
dropped to 0 psi at the end point (100% conversion). The total pressure
was then equal to the pad gas pressure. The experimental results were
in good agreement with the prediction within the mutual error. The
results showed that the addition of solvent or the lowering of mass
fraction was an effective measure to prolong TMR and moderate the
rate of heat release. However, volatile solvents lead to a higher
pressure rise even at lower temperatures, which introduces a different
kind of hazard which has to be taken into consideration when designing
the vapor relief systems.</p><p>The experimental and lumped kinetic
modeling results reported herein
should be considered in the light of some limitations. First of all,
other species which are present in the polymer production such as
initiators, chain-transfer agents, or possible contaminants may also
have an impact on the thermal runaway behavior. Other scenarios and
further studies are necessary to be conducted to evaluate the synergistic
effects which arise from their presence. At the same time, the lumped
kinetic simulation with Hui and Hamielec model matched well with the
adiabatic self-heating rate for the concentrated samples at higher
temperature range while overestimated the rate of polymerization at
the initial stage. This deviation may be caused by the simplified
empirical correlation which was insufficient to provide detailed expressions
of rate constants for individual step in the free-radical polymerization
reaction. A series of more detailed kinetic studies have been carried
out by a working party of the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry (IUPAC) since 1988<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> to obtain the accurate
values of the critical rate constants for a variety of free-radical
polymerization systems. More specifically, for the styrene system,
the pulsed laser polymerization&#x02013;size exclusion chromatography
(PLP&#x02013;SEC) method was first used to obtain the benchmark value
of the propagation rate coefficient of styrene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> The change of initiator efficiency of 2,2&#x02032;-azoisobutyronitril
in styrene was evaluated under different temperature and pressure
conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> Most importantly, the experimental
method to accurately assess the termination rate coefficient has been
carefully reviewed for various free-radical polymerization systems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> followed by a recent experimental evaluation of the styrene termination
rate coefficient that covers the entire conversion range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> These benchmark values and IUPAC recommended
PLP&#x02013;SEC experimental method have facilitated the development
of numerous new kinetic models as summarized by Achilias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> The future utilization of these detailed nonempirical
kinetic modeling would enable a deeper understanding of styrene polymerization
thermal runaway behavior at bulk quantities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The effect of styrene mass fractions on the thermally
initiated
polymerization runaway hazards of the styrene&#x02013;ethylbenzene
system was studied using screening and adiabatic calorimeters. DSC
results confirmed a multipeak reaction exotherm between 100 and 300
&#x000b0;C. The addition of diluent effectively reduced overall heat
release by affecting the late stage of the reaction at higher temperatures
(&#x0003e;150 &#x000b0;C). Adiabatic tests identified a delayed and milder
self-polymerization
upon dilution, with higher detected &#x0201c;onset&#x0201d; temperature
and linearly decreased adiabatic temperature rise. Both screening
and adiabatic test results confirmed that the overall heat release
and reaction severity was reduced by the addition of the solvent.
At the same time, the pressure build-up rate and temperature rate
exponentially decreased with lower monomer mass fraction, proving
that dilution with solvent is an effective measure to moderate reaction
thermal hazards and as such it may form a sound inherently safer design
option, especially when the monomer mass fraction drops below 0.8.
However, when the monomer was diluted in ethylbenzene to 85% w/w,
the presence of volatile species resulted in a higher pressure-rise
during reaction runaway compared with the pure styrene system even
at lower temperatures. The lumped kinetic model developed by Hui and
Hamielec presented an excellent agreement with the experimental data
for both thermal and pressure hazards during the adiabatic thermal
runaway. The study revealed the complex role of solvent (ethylbenzene)
regarding the polymerization runaway hazards. Addition of solvents
into the polymerization system to mitigate the thermal risk may introduce
pressure risks because of the volatile nature of the solvent. Optimum
process design should be based on a thorough assessment of all types
of hazards present in the system.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="NOTES-d7e1610-autogenerated"><p>The authors declare no
