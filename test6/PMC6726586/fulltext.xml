Cells at telophase were observed to undergo a morphological reversal to anaphase, with the contractile ring being reopened and the cell shape reversing from dumb-bell back to spherical. Once restored to isosmotic environment, the reversed cells would either continue to divide or instead to form binuclear cells that further proliferated in runaway fashions. The immunofluorescent staining of tubulins and myosin II indicated that the hypotonic stress affected the accumulation of tubulins and myosin II at the contractile ring. Distinct from previous studies using specific chemical reagents, the present study provides a simple method to manipulate cell division. The morphological reversal is the adaption of dividing cells to the environmental change. The observation opens a new window to understand cell division mechanisms and runaways.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bioengineering</kwd><kwd>Hypotonicity</kwd><kwd>Osmotic</kwd><kwd>Division</kwd><kwd>Cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>Binuclear</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Together with the level change of proteins [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the mitotic process is accompanied by morphological transformation and volume change.

Hypotonic shock refers to an environment medium that is lower in solutes than that of the fluid inside of a cell. It is widely accepted that water will flow across the cell membrane into that cell from the surrounding hypotonic environment eventually causing the cell to swell and burst. Here we show that when treat dividing mammalian cells with highly hypotonic medium, the cytokinetic furrows would regress and the cells were morphologically reversed back to spherical shape. After the environment restored to isosmotic, some of the reversed cells went onto with a secondary cytokinesis; and some stopped the cytokinesis and became binuclear cells. We employed immunofluorescence to find the change of cytoskeleton of the aimed cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Experimental</title><p id="p0025">Human cervical cancer cell HeLa, human ovarian cancer cell SiHa and mouse fibroblast cell NIH-3T3 were cultured in isosmotic DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin solution (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Cultures were maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> as gas atmosphere. Hypotonic treatment was achieved by replacing DMEM medium by hypotonic solution. The hypotonic solution was made by diluting isosmotic phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution using deionized water. Concentration gradient was 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="p0030">The hypotonic treatment was conducted after the cells entered telophase when the cytokinetic furrows had been formed. A typical result is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>(a). At time zero, the target HeLa cell had come to its telophase. The two sets of daughter chromosomes had arrived at the pole of the spindle and decondensed. A new nuclear envelope reassembled around each set, completing the formation of the two nuclei. Then we replaced the medium by highly hypotonic i.e. 5% PBS solution. The highly hypotonic environment led to an immediate increase in the cell volume since water flew into the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>(a), 0&#x02013;6 min). After about 10 min of the hypotonic treatment, the midbody disappeared and the cytokinetic furrow started to retract. At the same time the newly formed nuclear envelope dissolved. The retraction lasted for tens of minutes until the furrow thoroughly disappear (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>(a), 42 min). After that, the cell further adjusted its shape to spherical (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>(a), 62 min) and the chromosomes aligned near the metaphase plate. The cell was therefore backing to its anaphase in morphology. Another example is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>(b).

Regarding the first step, as well known, the cytokinesis furrow is composed of myosin and bundles of F-actin. The myosin like motors intermediates the gliding of the F-actin and makes the furrow to contract. The observed furrow with loosing contractility under high hypotonicity is related to the disfunction of these two components. Regarding myosin, we have conducted immunofluorescence tests on tubulins and myosin of cytokinetic cells, Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>(i),(j).

Since myosin has been well identified as the force generator in furrow contraction [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the furrow would then lose the constriction force. Regarding F-actin, a series of studies in various cells types have suggested that F-actin network would be disrupted at the onset of osmotic swelling under hypotonicity stress [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example Pedersen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> demonstrated a decrease in cellular F-actin content within 3 min with a hypotonic challenge. In our cases as a proof, we used atomic force microscopy to measure the cell stiffness. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>, the stiffness decreased sharply in the first 2&#x02013;3 min when was the onset of osmotic swelling, indicating the disruption of F-actin since the membrane stiffness of living cells depends on the submembrane F-actin cytoskeleton as proved by Maa et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.<fig id="fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Typical AFM result of cell stiffness change during hypotonic treatment.

Then the second step, i.e. morphological reversal occurred. Still due to the hypotonicity, water kept fluxing into the cell and gradually increased the intracellular hydrostatic pressure. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>, at time 0 the culture medium was replaced by a 5% PBS solution. HeLa cells at metaphase were measured. Micro-sized blunt tip was used. The measurement was conducted at room temperature 25 &#x000b0;C. The value of Young's modulus at each data point was the average of 8&#x02013;16 data points detected by AFM within 15 s on an area of about 2*2 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup> on the cell surface. The Young's modulus decreased sharply in the first 2&#x02013;3mins, indicating the disruption of submembrane F-actin cytoskeleton. The gradual increase of the stiffness in the AFM result, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>, lasting for 30&#x02013;50 min in different cases, is the proof for the hydrostatic pressure increase due to water influx.</p><p id="p0080">It has been know that hydrodynamic pressure can mechanically control cell shapes <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The increased intracellular pressure swelled the cell, pushed open the furrow which had no contractility, thus rounded the cell up and finally a cell with double nucleus was formed. The rounding up process was also lasting for 30&#x02013;50 min as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>(a) (b), consistent with the time lasting for the pressure increase.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0085">As summary, hypotonicity quickly made the furrow lose the contractility by disrupting the myosin and F-actin, and then gradually rounded up the cell by increasing the hydrostatic pressure through water influx. The molecular mechanism of how hypotonicity disrupts myosin and F-actin, however, remains an open question despite the many studies. Overall the reversal can be regarded as the protection response of a cell to an emergency accident i.e. hypotonic shock in vitro. Enforcing the osmotically shocked cell to finish the cytokineisis would cause higher death ratio which have confirmed by our flavopiridol experiment as discussed.</p><p id="p0090">On the other hand, the present study has showed that high hypotonicity can be a new approach to manipulate cytokinesis. Previous studies always used chemical reagents to manipulate cytokinesis. For example cytochalasin B and its derivative dihydrocytochalasin B (H<sub>2</sub>CB) could inhibit cytokinesis and form binuclear cells [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Microtubule inhibitors colcemid, vinblastine <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and nocodazole [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] were discovered to inhibit cell division by affecting microtubule functions. Psychosine, a lipid metabolite, was found to affect actin reorganization and inhibit cytokinesis. Studies showed that it might account for the formation of multinuclear globoid cells in the brains of patients with globoid cell leukodystrophy <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. 1-<italic>O</italic>-Octadecyl-2-<italic>O</italic>-methyl- glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH<sub>3</sub>) `s could inhibit cell division and the reason might be related to cytoskeletal effects <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Here we have shown that high hypotonicity can stop and reverse the cytokinesis. Moreover, the reversal could be reversible since the cytokinesis could be continued once the environment restored isosmotic. The reversal is an adaption to the environmental osmotic pressure change. We believe it opens a new window to understand division mechanisms, cell cycle reversibility as well as runaways. Overall the present study is reporting preliminary observations, and intensive study of molecular mechanisms is needed in the future to establish the link between physical phenomenon i.e. osmotic equilibration with a biochemical process i.e. the regulation of mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="sec5.1"><label>5.1</label><title>Cells preparations</title><p id="p0095">Human cervical cancer cell HeLa, human ovarian cancer cell SiHa and mouse fibroblast cell NIH-3T3 were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin solution (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone, Logan, UT).
