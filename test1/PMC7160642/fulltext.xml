Because of the lower run rates, domestic demand for crude oil has nosedived by 2.4&#x000a0;M barrels/d and refining margins have hovered around multi-year lows. According to ICIS, crude demand in China will decrease year on year for the first time in decades in 1Q 2020 while refinery run rates will drop by 4% in Jan-Mar 2020 and by nearly 10.4% to 153.35-153.45&#x000a0;M tonnes (12.3&#x000a0;M barrels/d) from 1Q 2019. Run rates were previously projected to increase by 3% or more in 1Q 2020 in the wake of Zhejiang Petrochemical's commercial- scale startup in early Dec 2019. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, &#x02018;teapot&#x02019; or independent refineries accounted for around 30% of refining capacity in China. Shandong, where most teapot refiners are located, run rates are more than 25% lower than pre-virus levels and the lowest since Sep 2014. By end-Feb 2020, these rates are expected to fall even further to a six-year low. Shandong-based teapot refiners also saw their refining margins tumble to minus Yuan 805/tonne on 5 Feb 2020, while those of major refiners declined by 57% from mid-Jan 2020. For major refiners in other parts of the country, daily crude production and operating rates will decline by 13% and 18%, respectively, in Feb 2020. In contrast, private integrated refiners of petrochemicals, including Zhejiang Petrochemical and Hengli Petrochemical, are running at optimum rates. During the Lunar New Year holiday, Hengli Petrochemical's run rates have exceeded full capacity to produce a steady volume of polypropylene (PP), while Zhejiang Petrochemical's two crude distillation units (CDUs) are running at almost 100%. A graph shows the run rates of Shandong's independent refiners for the period 2014-2020, while a second graph shows the run rates of China's major refiners for 2015-2020.</p><p id="par0010">Original Source: ICIS Chemical Business,17 MAR 2020 (Website: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icis.com/" id="intr0005">http://www.icis.com</ext-link>) &#x000a9; Reed Business Information Limited 2020.</p></body></article>
