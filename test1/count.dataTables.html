The objective of our study was to compare the performance of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody detection by chemiluminescence immunoassay (CIA) and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).Methods: Sera from outpatients who were suspected to have anti-GBM disease and 31 patients with biopsy-proven anti-GBM disease were collected. Thirty normal controls were also included. All samples were tested for anti-GBM antibodies by CIA and commercial ELISA. The anti-GBM antibody-positive samples were confirmed by a homemade ELISA coated with recombinant human α3(IV)NC1.Results: Compared with detection of anti-GBM antibodies with ELISA, detection of anti-GBM antibodies with CIA showed a positivity agreement of 70% and a negativity agreement of 98.6%. Among the 4 patients with different results, the anti-GBM antibody detection by CIA was in agreement with the homemade ELISA coated with recombinant human α3(IV)NC1 and the clinical diagnosis. In 31 patients with anti-GBM disease, good agreement was achieved in the detection of anti-GBM antibodies with CIA, commercial ELISA and the homemade ELISA (100%, 100%). The AUC for CIA and commercial ELISA was 0.987 and 0.966, respectively.Conclusions: The detection of anti-GBM antibodies with CIA demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity and was in good agreement with our homemade ELISA, which seems better than the commercial ELISA in suspected anti-GBM disease patients. The three assays performed in parallel in the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease patients.">

In this paper we develop a dynamic model of debt runs based on He and Xiong (2012) to identify, both conceptually and quantitatively, the value of a liquidity backstop for its run-mitigating role. For the purpose of identification, we focus on the municipal bond markets for variable rate demand obligations and auction rate securities. Based on the run episodes in these markets during the financial crisis of 2007-09 and the calibrated model, we find that the value of a liquidity backstop is about 14.5 basis points per annum. Our findings have important policy implications regarding the effectiveness of liquidity backstops in ameliorating problems of financial instability.">

Methods:Twenty (10 Females, 10 Males) healthy master class runners were recruited. Each participant completed the HIIT consisting of six repetitions of 800 m with a 1:1 work: rest ratio. The MICR duration was set to match energy expenditure of the HIIT session. Hip and knee muscular strength were examined pre and post both HIIT and MICR. Kinematics and running variability for hip and knee, along with spatiotemporal parameters were assessed at start and end of each run-type. Changes in variables were examined using both 2 × 2 ANOVAs with repeated measures and on an individual level when the change in a variable exceeded the minimum detectable change (MDC). Results:All strength measures exhibited significant reductions at the hip and knee (P &lt; 0.05) with time for both run-types; 12% following HIIT, 10.6% post MICR. Hip frontal plane kinematics increased post run for both maximum angle (P &lt; 0.001) and range of motion (P = 0.003). Runners exhibited increased running variability for nearly all variables, with the HIIT having a greater effect. Individual assessment revealed that not all runners were effected post run and that following HIIT more runners had reduced muscular strength, altered kinematics and increased running variability. Conclusion:Runners exhibited fatigue induced changes following typical training runs, which could potentially present risk of injury development. Group and individual assessment revealed different findings where the use of MDC is recommended over that of P-values.">

Even though many methods and algorithms have been proposed, their relative advantages and limitations are still not well established. Moreover, these methods involve tuning multiple parameters, for which no principled way of selection exists yet. These uncertainties are emphasized due to the lack of ground-truth for their validation and testing. Here we present the Localize-MI dataset, which constitutes the first open dataset that comprises EEG recorded electrical activity originating from precisely known locations inside the brain of living humans. High-density EEG was recorded as single-pulse biphasic currents were delivered at intensities ranging from 0.1 to 5 mA through stereotactically implanted electrodes in diverse brain regions during pre-surgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. The uses of this dataset range from the estimation of in vivo tissue conductivity to the development, validation and testing of forward and inverse solution methods.">

        <span class="abst" title="Data saturation is the most commonly employed concept for estimating sample sizes in qualitative research. Over the past 20 years, scholars using both empirical research and mathematical/statistical models have made significant contributions to the question: How many qualitative interviews are enough? This body of work has advanced the evidence base for sample size estimation in qualitative inquiry during the design phase of a study, prior to data collection, but it does not provide qualitative researchers with a simple and reliable way to determine the adequacy of sample sizes during and/or after data collection. Using the principle of saturation as a foundation, we describe and validate a simple-to-apply method for assessing and reporting on saturation in the context of inductive thematic analyses. Following a review of the empirical research on data saturation and sample size estimation in qualitative research, we propose an alternative way to evaluate saturation that overcomes the shortcomings and challenges associated with existing methods identified in our review. Our approach includes three primary elements in its calculation and assessment: Base Size, Run Length, and New Information Threshold. We additionally propose a more flexible approach to reporting saturation. To validate our method, we use a bootstrapping technique on three existing thematically coded qualitative datasets generated from in-depth interviews. Results from this analysis indicate the method we propose to assess and report on saturation is feasible and congruent with findings from earlier studies.">

We evaluated the potential conflict between biodiversity protection and future electricity generation from renewable (wind farms, run-of-river hydro) and non-renewable (shale gas) sources in British Columbia (BC), Canada using three metrics: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electricity cost, and overlap between future development and conservation priorities for several fish and wildlife groups - small-bodied vertebrates, large mammals, freshwater fish - and undisturbed landscapes. Sharp trade-offs in global versus regional biodiversity conservation exist for all energy technologies, and in BC they are currently smallest for wind energy: low GHG emissions, low-moderate overlap with top conservation priorities, and competitive energy cost. GHG emissions from shale gas are 1000 times higher than those from renewable sources, and run-of-river hydro has high overlap with conservation priorities for small-bodied vertebrates. When all species groups were considered simultaneously, run-of-river hydro had moderate overlap (0.56), while shale gas and onshore wind had low overlap with top conservation priorities (0.23 and 0.24, respectively). The unintended cost of distributed energy sources for regional biodiversity suggest that trade-offs based on more diverse metrics must be incorporated into energy planning.">

Methods: This was a historical cohort study, three independent lung cancer cohorts included. One cohort was used to evaluate the stability of radiomics features, one cohort was used to feature selection, and the last was used to construct and evaluate classification models. The research is divided into four steps: region of interest segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model building and validation. The feature selection methods included the intraclass correlation coefficient, ReliefF coefficient, and Partition-Membership filter. The performance metrics of the classification model included accuracy (Acc), precision (Pre), area under curve (AUC), and kappa statistics. Results: The 10 features (First order shape features: Sphericity and Compacity, Gray-Level Run Length Matrix: Short-Run Emphasis, Low Gray-level Run Emphasis, and High Gray-level Run Emphasis, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix: Homogeneity, Energy, Contrast, Correlation, and Dissimilarity) showed the most stable and classification capability. The 6 classifiers, Logistic regression classifier (LR), Sequence Minimum Optimization algorithm, Random Forest, KStar, Naive Bayes and Random Committee, have great performance both on the train and the test sets, and especially LR has the best performance on the test set (Acc = 98.72, Pre = 0.988, AUC = 1, and kappa = 0.974). Conclusion: Lung adenocarcinoma can be identified based on CT radiomics features. We can diagnose lung adenocarcinoma with CT non-invasively.">

A data-driven MVPA and machine-learning approach revealed that neural response patterns of engineering students were convergent with each other and distinct from novices’ when considering physical forces acting on the structures. Furthermore, informational network analysis demonstrated that the distinct neural response patterns of engineering students reflected relevant concept knowledge: learned categories of mechanical structures. Information about mechanical categories was predominantly represented in bilateral anterior ventral occipitotemporal regions. Importantly, mechanical categories were not explicitly referenced in the experiment, nor does visual similarity between stimuli account for mechanical category distinctions. The results demonstrate how learning abstract STEM concepts in the classroom influences neural representations of objects in the world.">
