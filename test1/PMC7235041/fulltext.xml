Using fMRI, we presented photographs of real-world structures to engineering students with classroom-based knowledge and hands-on lab experience, examining how their brain activity differentiated them from their &#x0201c;novice&#x0201d; peers not pursuing engineering degrees. A data-driven MVPA and machine-learning approach revealed that neural response patterns of engineering students were convergent with each other and distinct from novices&#x02019; when considering physical forces acting on the structures. Furthermore, informational network analysis demonstrated that the distinct neural response patterns of engineering students reflected relevant concept knowledge: learned categories of mechanical structures. Information about mechanical categories was predominantly represented in bilateral anterior ventral occipitotemporal regions. Importantly, mechanical categories were not explicitly referenced in the experiment, nor does visual similarity between stimuli account for mechanical category distinctions. The results demonstrate how learning abstract STEM concepts in the classroom influences neural representations of objects in the world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Human behaviour</kwd><kwd>Learning and memory</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Learning changes perception. Over the course of learning, advanced students and experts grow to see the world differently from novice learners as a function of their knowledge and prior experience (e.g., chess<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, physics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>). For example, seminal work in cognitive psychology has demonstrated that when given the same set of physics practice problems, individuals with advanced knowledge of physics categorize the problems according to the abstract concept knowledge underlying each problem, whereas novices categorize problems according to the perceivable surface-level features of each problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although a large body of neuroscience research has focused on the neural representation of visually perceivable categories<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, the way in which abstract STEM concept knowledge is represented in the brain remains less explored. Here, using a cross-sectional design, we investigate how prior classroom-based and lab-based learning experiences influence the neural patterns that represent abstract conceptual categories when presented with naturalistic stimuli.</p><p id="Par3">To date, only a few neuroimaging studies have investigated physics and engineering concept knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Results of this research implicate dorsal stream regions&#x02014;including motor cortex&#x02014;in the explicit retrieval of task-specific physics knowledge. However, in a naturalistic test of conceptual understanding, an important outcome of successful learning should be the ability to observe real-world stimuli and implicitly retrieve conceptual category information not available to novices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Because prior fMRI studies of physics knowledge have focused on explicit retrieval of information about non-naturalistic stimuli, the question of how abstract physics and engineering knowledge is implicitly activated by real-world stimuli remains unresolved.</p><p id="Par4">Within other concept domains, numerous fMRI studies have tied both explicit and implicit visual categorization&#x02014;including categories based on real-world stimuli&#x02014;to patterns of brain activity in the ventral visual stream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For example, Connolly et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> have demonstrated that patterns of neural activity in ventral occipitotemporal cortex can reliably classify images of animals (viewed during an incidental task) into abstract conceptual categories. In the present study, we apply this analytical approach to the domain of mechanical engineering. Our aim is to identify patterns of brain activity associated with real-world stimuli that implicitly reflect learned abstract mechanical category information.</p><p id="Par5">In pursuit of this aim, we recruited two groups of participants: a group of undergraduate mechanical engineering students with knowledge drawn from engineering lecture courses and hands-on laboratory experiences, and a control group of their peers: novice students at the same university matched for educational attainment. (Note that engineering students at the present institution do not have separate admissions criteria from students in other disciplines; the distinction between novice and engineering students in the present study is simply that engineering students had completed certain engineering and physics courses, whereas novice students had not elected any advanced courses in engineering or physics.) Both groups performed an fMRI concept knowledge task in which participants evaluated the Newtonian forces acting on a set of real-world structures. Using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of neuroimaging data, we first identified convergent patterns of neural activity among engineering students and among novices. Then, for each group, we performed an informational network analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, a variant of representational similarity analysis (RSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>), to query those activity patterns for the presence of concept knowledge information about the mechanical categories of structures. As a control, we also evaluated the contribution of bottom-up perceptual information to these neural patterns using a forward-encoding model of primary visual cortex (HMAX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>). In this way, we identified reliable neural patterns reflective of mechanical category knowledge elicited by real-world stimuli. By comparing these patterns across the two groups of students, our results reveal the influence of prior learning experiences on the neural representation of abstract STEM concepts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Engineering students demonstrate knowledge of Newtonian forces</title><p id="Par6">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the trial structure and behavioral results from the free body diagram (FBD) task that participants completed during fMRI scan.

Task performance at fMRI run 1 maximally reflects the variance in prior knowledge and experience among participants. Consequently, fMRI data from run 1 are the most likely to show distinct patterns of brain activity associated with concept knowledge for engineering students compared to novices, if such a distinction should occur at all. In contrast, by fMRI run 4 we observe that participants from both groups have mastered the FBD task. It is therefore difficult to dissociate the effects of task-specific learning from the effects of prior knowledge and experience in any analysis of fMRI data from run 4. Thus, neural data from run 1 are analyzed here to identify the distinct and overlapping patterns of neural activity by group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and the neural patterns reflecting mechanical and visual information by group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Novices and engineering students show distinct and overlapping patterns of neural activity.</title><p> The schematic to the left describes the analytical procedure: First, in each subject&#x02019;s brain, we computed a data-driven neural dissimilarity matrix (DM) at each surface node, consisting of the pairwise comparisons between stimulus items. Then, these individual subjects&#x02019; node-level DMs were correlated across subjects within each group. A noise threshold was applied using the negative extent of the intersubject correlations as a chance estimate. Finally, results were subjected to a spatial cluster correction on the cortical surface, retaining only clusters of at least five contiguous surface nodes. The brain surface maps on the right show regions where intersubject DM correlations were above the chance threshold for engineering students only (green), novices only (blue), and both groups (red). Anatomical reference labels have been added for M1, vOT, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and calcarine sulcus (V1). Engineering students showed unique representational convergence in motor regions including M1, as well as ventral PFC and inferior parietal regions. Novice-specific regions included more anterior frontal regions and more dorsal parietal regions. Groups overlapped in representational convergence in occipital regions, including vOT until the most anterior regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41539_2020_65_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e492"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Neural patterns reflect mechanical category information within group-specific regions, whereas visual similarity information is represented in overlapping regions.</title><p> Mechanical category informational gradients for engineering students (top left) and novices (top right), accompanied by the model DM for the mechanical categories of the stimuli.

For each individual participant at every surface node in the brain, we computed a dissimilarity matrix (DM) from the pairwise comparisons of item-level beta estimates at each node. Then, separately for each group, we computed the average (<italic>z</italic>-transformed) intersubject correlations of the DMs at each node. Finally, we used the negative extent of the correlation results as an estimate of the range of correlation values attributable to chance, resulting in a noise threshold of <italic>z</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02 (see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Methods</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for a validation of the noise threshold using permuted null distributions of intersubject correlation values).

Importantly, this analysis was entirely data-driven; at no point was an a priori representational model introduced. (This analysis is described in full detail in the &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; section; see the subsection &#x0201c;Multivariate neural pattern analysis&#x0201d;, steps 1 and 2).</p><p id="Par9">Out of 20,484 total nodes across the brain surface, there were 1,863 nodes where only engineering students showed above-threshold intersubject correlations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, green), 842 nodes where only novices showed above-threshold intersubject correlations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, blue), and 2,426 nodes where both groups show above-threshold intersubject correlations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, red). Representational convergence among engineering students was notably localized to motor regions including primary motor cortex (M1), portions of ventral prefrontal cortex (PFC), and inferior parietal regions. Representational convergence among novices was predominantly localized to more anterior frontal regions and superior parietal regions. The representational convergence maps for the two groups overlapped in regions including visual cortex, dorsal occipital cortex, and ventral occipitotemporal (vOT) cortex, although the groups remained distinct in the most anterior representations in vOT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Neural patterns reflect mechanical category knowledge in engineering students</title><p id="Par10">To unpack the neural distributions of mechanical and visual information for each group within the regions of distinct and overlapping neural representations identified in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we computed an informational network analysis (see subsection &#x0201c;Multivariate neural pattern analysis&#x0201d;, steps 3 and 4 in the &#x0201c;Methods&#x0201d; section). First, for each group, we identified networks of brain regions within each of the distinct and overlapping areas with similar representations for the stimulus items, independent of any a priori representational model. Within the regions of high representational convergence among engineering students, a split-half repeated cross-validation procedure yielded 65 informational networks for engineering students and 67 informational networks for novices. Within the regions of high representational convergence for novices, the same procedure yielded 46 informational networks for engineering students and 28 informational networks for novices. Finally, within the regions where both groups showed high representational convergence, we identified 100 informational networks for each group.</p><p id="Par11">After identifying the informational networks at the group level, we returned to the level of the individual participant. We computed the average representational DM for each informational network separately for each participant. The informational network DMs for each participant were then correlated with a mechanical category information model DM, as well as a visual similarity model DM as a control analysis. The mechanical category DM was generated using the pairwise similarity ratings of a mechanical engineering expert, and delineated three discrete categories of mechanical structures into which the stimulus set could be divided: cantilevers, trusses, and vertical loads. The visual similarity model DM for the stimulus items was generated using the HMAX forward-encoding model of primary visual cortex. Finally, we computed a summary statistic for the mechanical and visual correlation results at the group level using one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests against zero.</p><p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the cortical surface maps for mechanical category representations and the visual similarity representations for each group.

Peak mechanical category representations for both groups came from group-specific distinct regions: the peak bilateral vOT and left M1 informational networks for engineering students came from areas with high representational convergence only among engineering students, suggesting that convergence among engineering students&#x02019; representations in those brain regions reflects a convergence upon mechanical representations.

However, to provide a thorough treatment of the data, we also analyzed the results of the fourth and final fMRI run using the same multivariate intersubject correlation and RSA methods applied to fMRI run 1. The results of this analysis show that the neural and behavioral changes that take place between run 1 and run 4 of the fMRI task were likely predominantly associated with task-specific learning (i.e., identifying the now-familiar stimulus as either the correct or incorrect exemplar), and were not clearly associated with changes in conceptual knowledge over the course of the experiment. Participants did still show distinct neural representations between groups at run 4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), although there were fewer overall convergent representations for each group (15 unique informational networks for engineering students, 2 unique informational networks for novices, and 43 informational networks for each group in regions of overlapping representational convergence). Furthermore, regions of representational convergence overall were almost entirely localized to vOT, with just one posterior parietal region of convergence for each group in the right hemisphere and no convergent representations in dorsal premotor or primary motor areas. Finally, results from the RSA for run 4 revealed that those convergent representations that did emerge for each group were no longer as strongly reflective of mechanical category information (but remained as strongly reflective of visual feature information as at run 1; Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Participants in each group show less convergent neural activity at the last fMRI run.</title><p> Brain surface maps of the results from fMRI run 4 for the same analysis applied to fMRI run 1 in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Compared to run 1, participants at run 4 showed fewer regions where intersubject DM correlations at run 4 were above the chance threshold for engineering students only (green), novices only (blue), and both groups (red). Each group had some representational convergence in right posterior parietal cortex, but otherwise convergent representations were found only in vOT. Engineering students showed more anterior representational convergence in vOT than novices.

At the beginning of the experiment, the fact that there were group differences in neural representations at all <italic>must</italic> depend on the prior exposure to STEM education of the participants, because that is the only task-relevant dimension on which the participants varied upon beginning the experiment. By the end of the experiment, however, participants from both groups had improved on the behavioral task (although engineering students appear to encounter a ceiling effect; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), despite not receiving any feedback about their task performance. This behavioral change is therefore not likely to derive from changes in conceptual understanding of physics and engineering, and indeed the observed changes in neural representational content are not consistent with an increase in the representation mechanical category information for either group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Thus, the results from fMRI run 4 reveal that our multivariate analytical approach is particularly sensitive to the representations that participants are using at a given point during the fMRI experiment, and fMRI run 1 is the only point in the experiment where participants&#x02019; representations can be reasonably inferred to derive from differences in STEM concept knowledge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par17">The results of the present study demonstrate that classroom-based knowledge and experience inform the neural representations that students access when applying this knowledge in a naturalistic context. Our results show that engineering students exhibited convergent multivariate neural response patterns for real-world structures that strongly reflected information about the mechanical categories of those structures (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This finding is additionally striking because no explicit mention of any structural categories was made at any point during the experiment. Therefore, viewing of the task stimuli in the context of mechanical force evaluation was sufficient to activate the conceptual category information that engineering students had previously learned.</p><p id="Par18">Results from the informational network analysis and the FBD task further support the interpretation that these neural patterns reflect abstract concept knowledge. At the beginning of the experiment, while engineering students explicitly demonstrated knowledge about mechanical force (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; high FBD task accuracy), their brain activity implicitly reflected mechanical category information about the structures considered in the task (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In contrast, novices showed poor explicit understanding of mechanical force during the first fMRI run (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; low FBD task accuracy), and their brain activity during this run reflected no significant mechanical category representations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that (1) abstract concept knowledge that engineering students acquire in school is activated in response to real-world stimuli, and (2) this learned categorical knowledge can be identified within their multivariate neural response patterns.</p><p id="Par19">The group differences in neural representation of engineering concept knowledge become more pronounced when compared with the results of the visual similarity control (HMAX) analysis. Unlike mechanical category information, visual feature information was significantly represented in brain regions where both engineering students and novices showed convergence in their multivariate neural response patterns (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These regions where both groups exhibited strong representations of item-level visual similarity were localized to posterior visual cortex, as expected. Notably, the anterior-to-posterior gradient of increasing visual similarity information in the ventral stream was opposite to the posterior-to-anterior gradient of increasing mechanical category information exhibited in the same region, leading us to conclude that visual and mechanical representations are supported by distinct brain regions, and that effective mechanical categorization of the stimulus items cannot be achieved using only the items&#x02019; visual feature similarities.</p><p id="Par20">In terms of the localization of abstract mechanical force knowledge, it is interesting that we observe ventral stream results consistent with prior work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Here, engineering students showed categorical concept knowledge represented in bilateral anterior vOT. We also observe a gradient of increasing mechanical category information in the dorsal stream, which is notable given prior research on the neural correlates of learned physics concepts (e.g., torque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, forces and causal motion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). In fact, these previous studies have localized explicit knowledge of linear and rotational force to many of the same specific regions we observe for the representation of mechanical force categories, including in particular M1, in which we observe representational convergence only for engineering students (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). An intriguing possibility&#x02014;to be explored by further research&#x02014;is that the involvement of M1 in representing abstract concept knowledge for engineering students might be a function of their prior hands-on experiences in their lab-based coursework. Such an interpretation would be consistent with the studies cited above, as well as with our finding that novices show only premotor representations and not primary motor representations.</p><p id="Par21">An additional aspect of the representational localization results that is worth highlighting is the comparison between the multivariate representational analyses employed here and traditional univariate contrasts of neural activity levels between the two participant groups. A supplementary univariate analysis (detailed in <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Methods</xref>) revealed a convergent finding that engineering students&#x02019; cognition during these tasks is supported by motor and premotor and parietal regions in a way that is not observed for novices (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). However, that finding alone does not answer the question of where the item-level representations are housed and whether those representations differ between groups. Our multivariate analysis suggests that there is indeed a critical difference in item-level representations of conceptual information, but that those representational differences are most pronounced in the anterior ventral stream&#x02014;a region that does not come out of the univariate general linear model (GLM). This difference between an analysis of global signal change and an analysis of representational geometry is precisely the advantage offered by MVPA techniques such as RSA.</p><p id="Par22">One important feature distinguishing our current study from prior work is our use of naturalistic task stimuli in the form of real-world photographs, whereas these previous studies used fMRI tasks that were modeled after a specific lab task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> or that resembled taking a physics test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the dorsal stream regions we observe have been consistently implicated in the extensive body of neuroimaging and neuropsychology investigations of the neural system underlying tool use and object knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">The research presented in the current study is not without certain limitations. As with any cross-sectional study, it is possible that some of the differences we observe derive from individual differences that are not related to participants&#x02019; educational background. However, there are several reasons why we believe extraneous individual differences are unlikely to have influenced the primary findings in this study. First, participants in this study were all enrolled in a university with among the most highly selective admissions criteria in the United States. As a result, factors such as general cognitive ability and even specific proficiencies (e.g., as represented by SAT math scores) are of a highly restricted range for both groups of participants. Moreover, unlike other institutions where technical or engineering schools have separate admissions criteria from the liberal arts college, the institution where the research was conducted requires identical admissions criteria for students entering into any discipline, including engineering. This reduces the likelihood of selection bias in terms of admission to the population from which participants were drawn.</p><p id="Par24">In the present study, we demonstrated that STEM knowledge that students learned in school influenced their neural representations of real-world objects. The multivariate neuroimaging approach used here effectively differentiated groups of students on the basis of their prior knowledge and experience in the domain of mechanical engineering. Moreover, beyond merely demonstrating similar neural patterns among engineering students, our analyses revealed expert-like engineering knowledge within these patterns. Using this and other similar approaches, future research will elucidate the neural underpinnings of knowledge in other STEM concept domains, as well as investigate changes in neural representations of concept knowledge as STEM learning takes place over time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par25">Thirty-three students at Dartmouth College participated in this study.

Next, the normalized correlations were calculated between each informational network DM and a model DM representing the mechanical structure category for each stimulus item. Mechanical category information for the stimulus set was determined in consultation with a field expert (author SGD), and was never explicitly identified or discussed during the experiment to any participant. Normalized correlations were computed by first normalizing each informational network DM as well as the mechanical category target DM, and then computing the dot product of each informational network DM and the mechanical category DM. Finally, within each group, participant-level correlation distributions (<italic>z</italic>-values) across the informational networks were subjected to a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test against zero to identify the degree to which each informational network&#x02019;s representation consistently correlated with the mechanical or visual DM across the members of a group.</p><p id="Par47">The group-level results from the one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were projected onto the cortical surface, yielding a surface map for each group showing the gradient of mechanical category information represented across the informational networks for each group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). As a supporting visualization of the item-level representations in each informational network, the average informational network DMs for the peak regions of mechanical category information from each group were extracted, and item-level representations were rendered using 3-dimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS; &#x0201c;smacof&#x0201d; R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>).

To validate our analysis of mechanical information from neural activity patterns, we performed a control analysis using a model of visual similarity between items in the stimulus set. For this control analysis, we computed a visual similarity model of the stimuli using a forward-encoding model of primary visual cortex (HMAX, C1 layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>).
