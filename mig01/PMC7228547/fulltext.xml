Ethanol extract of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> (EEA) has been widely studied for its health benefits including anticancer effects. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of EEA on HNSCC. Cell proliferation, transwell, and wound healing assays were performed. The impact of EEA on tumor growth was investigated using a xenograft model. Expressions of migration-related proteins (MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2) and apoptosis-related proteins (cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP) were determined using western blot analysis. The results indicated that EEA significantly inhibited the capacities of proliferation, invasion, and migration of HNSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP expressions were increased in cells treated with an increasing concentration of EEA, which suggested that EEA induced apoptosis of HNSCC. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were downregulated when cells were administered EEA, while TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were not affected, which uncovered the mechanisms mediating the EEA-induced inhibition on cell invasion and migration. The animal experiment also suggested that EEA inhibited tumor growth. Our study confirmed the inhibitive effects of EEA on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of HNSCC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, providing the basis for further study of the application of EEA as an effective candidate for cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Antrodia cinnamomea</kwd><kwd>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells</kwd><kwd>Proliferation</kwd><kwd>Invasion</kwd><kwd>Migration</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="28"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors, representing over 95% of all head and neck cancer cases (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Despite advanced prevention and treatment strategies, thousands of new cases are reported annually (<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), while treatment outcomes are still unsatisfactory with a five-year overall survival of about 50% (<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Most patients experience recurrence and poor prognosis after surgical resection, leading to a high mortality rate (<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Studies have revealed that the high recurrence rate is mainly due to enhanced invasion, migration, and proliferation capacities of tumor cells (<xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The development of new chemotherapeutic agents for HNSCC is urgently needed.</p><p>
<italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> has been commonly used as a traditional Taiwanese medicine for its diverse applications in healthcare including anticancer effects (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).

The protective role of the ethanol extract of fruiting bodies of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> has been experimentally demonstrated in several malignancies including renal cancer (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), lung cancer (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and breast cancer (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), while the effects on head and neck cancer were seldom evaluated (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Several active components isolated from raw extracts of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic>, mainly including triterpenoids, dicarboxylic acids, and polysaccharides (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), have been identified and can effectively inhibit proliferation, invasion, and migration of tumor cells (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Moreover, extracts of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> were reported to sensitize lung cancer cells and hepatic carcinoma cells to chemotherapeutics (<xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), indicating it can serve as a promising source of adjuvant agents combined with conventional therapy.

This study investigated the effects of EEA on proliferation and migration of HNSCC cells, and we found that EEA might inhibit proliferation and migration of SAS in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, advanced experiments were conducted to briefly determine the mechanisms of the EEA-induced impact on SAS. We observed that cellular levels of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP were upregulated in cells treated with increasing doses of EEA, implying that provoking cell apoptosis was one of the mechanisms mediating the effect of EEA on proliferation. Recent study demonstrated that EEA could induce cell cycle arrest of lung cancer cells, thus leading to proliferation inhibition (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Tumor metastasis is a complicated process involving diverse types of proteins, of which the most well studied are MMPs and TIMP.

A study focusing on lung cancer also reported that extracts of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> decreased expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as their activities, which was ascribed to dysregulation of ERK, JNK, p38, and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways (<xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). A constituent isolated from <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> was confirmed to be an anti-metastatic compound mostly via reducing expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and enhancing E-cadherin and TIMP-1 expression (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Natural products extracted from plants or microorganisms are important sources for drug screening (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).

Several investigations have already shown the synergistic effects of EEA combined with cisplatin (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), sorafenib (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and tamoxifen (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The anti-tumor effect of EEA has been confirmed in a randomized controlled study, although the synergistic effects of EEA combined with chemotherapy were not observed (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). It has been proposed that cancer stem-like cells were involved in tumor initiation and occurrence of chemoradiotherapy resistance, responsible for compromised clinical outcomes of conventional therapies (<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Su et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) reported that extracts of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> sensitize cancer stem-like cells including HNSCC to chemoradiotherapy. Collectively, extracts of <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> are an important source for new drug discovery.</p><p>We conclude that this study comprehensively verified the inhibitive effects of EEA on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of HNSCC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the potential molecular mechanism mediating the observed effects. These findings provide the basis for further study of the application of EEA as an effective candidate for cancer treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This project
