Like other forms of partial migration, it provides spatial buffering against regional differences in habitat quality and sources of mortality. We investigated differential migration and its consequences to survival and reproductive patterns in striped bass, a species with well-known plasticity in migration behaviors. A size-stratified sample of Potomac River (Chesapeake Bay) <italic>Morone saxatilis</italic> striped bass was implanted with acoustic transmitters and their subsequent coastal shelf migrations recorded over a 4-yr period by telemetry receivers throughout the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Southern New England. A generalized linear mixed model predicted that &#x02265; 50% of both males and females depart the Chesapeake Bay at large sizes &#x0003e;80 cm total length. Egressing striped bass exited through both the Chesapeake Bay mouth and Delaware Bay (via the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal), favoring the former. All large fish migrated to Massachusetts shelf waters and in subsequent years repeatedly returned to regions within Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays. Within this dominant behavior, minority behaviors included straying, skipped spawning, and residency by large individuals (those expected to migrate). Analysis of the last day of transmission indicated that small resident striped bass experienced nearly 2-fold higher loss rates (70% yr<sup>-1</sup>) than coastal shelf emigrants (37% yr<sup>-1</sup>). The study confirmed expectations for a threshold size at emigration and different mortality levels between Chesapeake Bay (resident) and ocean (migratory) population contingents; and supported the central premise of the current assessment and management framework of a two-contingent population: smaller Chesapeake Bay residents and a larger ocean contingent. An improved understanding of differential migration thus affords an opportunity to specify stock assessments according to different population sub-components, and tailor reference points and control rules between regions and fishing stakeholder groups.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission</institution></funding-source><award-id>16-0401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6007-4827</contrib-id><name><surname>Secor</surname><given-names>David H.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>DHS received support for this research by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission and the the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Chesapeake Bay Office: Grant No. 16-0401.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All data files are available in Dryad, Dataset, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1zcrjdfnw">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1zcrjdfnw</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data files are available in Dryad, Dataset, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1zcrjdfnw">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1zcrjdfnw</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Partial migration, the presence of resident and migratory ecotypes, influences how populations and metapopulations respond to regionally varying environmental and anthropogenic forcing, and can stabilize population dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The traditional view that migrations by fishes are uniform seasonal behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] has been challenged by mounting evidence for the prevalence of plasticity in migration behaviors. Partial migration, well known for taxa such as salmons and chars, is now known to be common in bony fishes, elasmobranchs, and indeed vertebrate taxa writ large [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Our improved understanding of migration behavior gives rise to a new and important challenge: building partial migration behaviors into conservation and stewardship frameworks that promote sustainability and resilience.</p><p>In partial migration systems, whether to migrate or not is often dependent on size&#x02013;known as differential migration [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Size shapes the outcome of migration through its influence on swimming performance, forage demand, predation risk, and reproductive provisioning [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For instance, reduced cost of movement with size could favor increased ranges in larger adults [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as is commonly observed among diverse taxa including cods, flatfishes, snappers and drums [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Still, in other species such as Pacific bluefin tuna <italic>Thunnus orientalis</italic>, juveniles exhibit increased levels of transoceanic migrations [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Farther ranging individuals will encounter differing environmental and anthropogenic conditions than those smaller (or larger) individuals that stay near home, resulting in more nuanced population outcomes than would be expected were seasonal migrations are uniform. Such outcomes can relate to differential survival, growth, and reproduction.</p><p>The importance of relating size-dependent migration behaviors to environments encountered by migratory and resident individuals is reflected in the problem of assessing and managing estuarine and shelf fisheries for Atlantic striped bass <italic>Morone saxatilis</italic>. Chesapeake Bay population striped bass are large (maxima: 40 kg; 150 cm total length (TL); 33 years; DHS, pers. obs), relatively late-maturing (female and male full maturation: 8 and 4 years, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), and migratory within NW Atlantic shelf and estuarine environments, spawning in tidal freshwater. After spawning, adults migrate north to New England waters in spring and summer and then migrate south during late fall and winter to South Atlantic Bight shelf waters as far south as North Carolina. Owing to their extent and productivity, natal habitats in the Chesapeake Bay contribute the most recruits to the US NW Atlantic [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], supporting both valuable commercial fisheries (2017: $4.6 million; 2.1 10<sup>3</sup> tons [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]) and recreational fisheries (top-ranked US marine recreational fishery: 2017: 17.2 10<sup>3</sup> tons [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Recreational fisheries predominate in shelf waters (although also occurring in the Chesapeake Bay) and target larger individuals. In comparison, most commercial landings are from the Chesapeake Bay and comprise smaller individuals. A recent assessment indicated that total mortality rates in the Chesapeake Bay were substantially higher than those for the shelf stock [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Managing US regional allocations of striped bass thus depends on predicting the size and age at which striped bass move from their natal estuary to shelf environments, given each region&#x02019;s unique size-dependent removal patterns [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Striped bass show high plasticity in migration behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Ocean incidence varies by sex and increases with size and age [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], although high abundance of smaller immature striped bass have been noted in near shelf waters [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Conversely, a minority of large adult striped bass never migrate to shelf waters [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Analyzing striped bass tagged in the Potomac River (Chesapeake Bay), Kohlenstein [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] advanced the earliest hypothesis related to differential migration: that young striped bass remain in or near the tributary in which they were spawned for two or three years. After this age, a substantial proportion (~50%) of immature females emigrate from the Bay, while the remaining immature and mature males remain in the Bay throughout their lives. In a Bayesian framework applied to conventional tagging data (n = 56 ocean returns), Dorazio et al. [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] contrasted patterns of likely size-specific egress by Chesapeake Bay and Hudson River striped bass and predicted that &#x02265;50% (TL<sub>50</sub>) of striped bass egress at sizes &#x0003e;80 cm TL, regardless of sex. Based on otolith tracer analysis of 82 females and 40 males, Secor and Piccoli [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] also detected a trend of increasing egress with length, with approximately 40% predicted to egress at &#x0003e;80 cm TL. In contrast to Dorazio et al.&#x02019;s prediction of full egress at &#x0003e;100 cm TL, Secor and Piccoli predicted that a small minority of these larger striped bass resided in the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>A unique and timely opportunity availed itself to leverage extensive coastal biotelemetry assets only recently deployed within the US NW Atlantic to understand the coastal migrations of striped bass through cooperative data sharing. During the period 2014&#x02013;2018, we tracked migrations of size-stratified groups of 75 (spring 2014), and 25 (fall 2014) Potomac River striped bass implanted with acoustic transmitters within the Chesapeake and throughout the US NW Atlantic Coast. Over 4 10<sup>5</sup> telemetry detections were compiled to address a set of hypotheses related to: seasonal migration patterns and degree of residency within the Chesapeake Bay, and patterns of inferred mortality, migration routes, straying and skipped spawning. These included expected seasonal shelf migration patterns, higher mortality in Chesapeake Bay residents, and incidence of straying and skipped spawning in both resident and migratory contingents [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study site and experimental fish</title><p>This study required animal research.

The sample size, 100, represented a compromise between cost and statistical power of inferences expected for this sample size based on binomial likelihood. Targeted size strata were 45&#x02013;60, 61&#x02013;70, 71&#x02013;80, and &#x0003e;80 cm TL. The smallest size class, which is not well represented in spawning runs, was sampled in the fall and represented the presumed resident group [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; larger size classes were drawn from the spring spawning run. Smaller-interval medium size classes focused on sizes where intermediate levels of emigration were expected. We contracted a commercial fishers to procure spring run striped bass through gill net sampling in the middle-Potomac River <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g001">Fig 1</xref>), releasing fish from 30 March to 11 April 2014. Similarly, we contracted a pound net fisher near the mouth of the Potomac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g001">Fig 1</xref>) to obtain and release smaller resident fish on 30 October 2014. Striped bass receiving transmitters ranged from 56&#x02013;106 cm and 45&#x02013;77 cm TL in the spring and fall releases, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

We implanted coded telemetry transmitters (VEMCO; model V16-4H-S256; 6.8 cm, 10 g, 3.0-year expected battery life, random ping rate 90&#x02013;120 s) following previous procedures [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] under an approved protocol by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science IACUC (#F-CBL-14-05). Striped bass were anesthetized in a solution of 60 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of tricaine methanesulfonate and 30 mg L<sup>-1</sup>of quinaldine sulfate. Following sedation, fish were measured for length and weight, and the transmitter implanted through a 25-mm midline incision located anterior to the pelvic girdle. Gonads were inspected through the incision for sex determination. The incision was closed using sterile, absorbable surgical monofilament. Fish were released following regaining equilibrium and locomotion in a large recovery tank. In previous experimental trials conducted on Patuxent River striped bass [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], this procedure resulted in no detectable long-term (3 month) changes to the stress or health of individuals. Transmitters were labeled to encourage the reporting of recapture information following harvest. External T-bar tags were attached, with a label requesting release and providing contact information (this resulted in three responses by fishers). Scales were collected during the surgical procedure and retained for age determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

Threshold sizes and age at migration were compared between years using likelihood ratio tests of each variable&#x02019;s nested GLMMs, where a significant interaction term implied a significant influence of year. Overall 50<sup>th</sup> percentile values were calculated by averaging the estimated parameters of each year and calculating a threshold value from the pooled estimate. Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each threshold value. Analyses were conducted using the <italic>lme4</italic> package, version 1.1&#x02013;21, in R, version 3.6.3 [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Prior to model fitting, fish analyzed for emigration were censored to include only those detected after August in a given year; it was assumed that coastal migration behavior would manifest within 3 months of the April-May spawning season. Years were demarcated as starting prior to the spawning season on March 1 of each year: 2014, March 1 2014&#x02014;February 28, 2015; 2015, March 1, 2015 &#x02013;February 29, 2016; 2016, March 1, 2016 &#x02013;February 28, 2017; and 2017, March 1, 2017 &#x02013;February 28, 2018. For each fish meeting this convention, receiver detections were classified as either ocean or Chesapeake Bay (bounded by the C&#x00026;D Canal and Bay Bridge Tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g001">Fig 1</xref>)). For age models, age-at-release was advanced in accordance to the year of comparison. Because no such adjustment could occur for size (unknown annual growth increment), year comparisons were limited to 2014&#x02013;2015 and 2015&#x02013;2016, assuming only a small incremental increase in size between these periods. To evaluate possible bias associated with combing fall and spring samples, each sample of spring-tagged fish was analyzed separately for size and age-thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Migration pathways</title><p>Egress pathway from the Chesapeake Bay to ocean waters was evaluated by detection of emigrants by receivers immediately inside or outside the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay and others occurring in the Chesapeake and Delaware (C&#x00026;D) Canal.

On the other hand, the Chesapeake Bay mouth is incompletely covered with respect to number of receivers and their expected detection ranges. Patterns of seasonal ocean migration were evaluated by depicting seasonal progression of detections at receivers ordered by latitude and region. Individual detections were assigned to shelf regions to depict seasonal shelf migration pathways. Shelf regions were assigned to represent clusters of receivers over the shelf and include New York (NY Harbor and its approaches), Long Island Sound, and coastal Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Skipping and straying</title><p>For fully mature individuals (&#x0003e;80 cm TL), evidence of spawning site fidelity was on the basis of 15 March&#x02013; 15 May detections by receivers at or above the Potomac River Nice Bridge, which occurs just downriver from spawning habitats [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Study striped bass emigrated at sizes greater than the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile threshold size of 80 cm TL (referenced as &#x0003e;80 cm TL in classifications used in Results). At these lengths, all males and most females are sexually mature [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and fish dominate the diet [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Locomotion costs decrease with fish size, increasing the capacity to exploit distant foraging habitats [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As fish migrate from natal waters, larger and farther ranging individuals may exhibit increased propensity to stray or skip spawning [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We observed the opposite (<xref rid="pone.0233103.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which could relate to learned migration circuits that may become increasingly rigid as they are repeated each year by older individuals. This speculation is supported by the rapid early summer transit to Massachusetts shelf waters by all emigrating Potomac striped bass. Strong inter-annual patterns of site fidelity to localized regions with Cape Cod and Massachusetts Bays, reported by Kneebone et al. [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], might also be achieved through learned migration behaviors. Additionally, smaller individuals were predominantly males, known to exhibit higher straying rates than females [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>To an unexpected degree, our threshold size (80 cm TL) and age (10 years) closely agreed with those documented in past studies (80 cm TL [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and 10&#x02013;12 years [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]); we had expected that telemetry of a moderately large sample would expose greater variance in movement behaviors than these past studies. In Dorazio et al.&#x02019;s analysis of tag recaptures, reporting rates were quite low (&#x0003c;5%; recapture sample = 56), likely introducing substantial error owing to reporting bias and low sample size. Secor and Piccoli back-calculated size at egress from otolith microchemical assays of large striped bass collected from the Northern Bay mainstem and Choptank River (Chesapeake Bay; n = 122), and observed that 50% emigrated by ages 10&#x02013;12, similar to that observed here. On the other hand, a substantial fraction of fish &#x0003e;10 years old were estimated to remain in the Chesapeake Bay. Still, the 29 salinity unit threshold used to distinguish oceanic from estuarine incidence by Secor and Piccoli is not mirrored by a threshold change in otolith Sr:Ca. Thus, threshold sizes and ages for egress are less well supported though otolith chemistry Sr:Ca than other approaches such as biotelemetry.</p><p>Biotelemetry research associated with the other two principal populations, the Hudson and Delaware Rivers, support similar size ranges for migratory ocean fish. All but one of 20 spawning-run Hudson River striped bass (82&#x02013;97 cm TL) migrated during summer months to Massachusetts waters [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The exceptional fish remained resident to the Hudson River estuary during the two-year study. Indeed, lifetime patterns of residency are well documented for Hudson River striped bass [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Size-dependent migrations for the Delaware population have not yet been specifically assessed, but a moderate fraction (12&#x02013;108) of large striped bass (65&#x02013;110 cm TL, mean = 88&#x000b1;11 cm) tagged and released in Massachusetts waters visited the Delaware Bay during the spawning season [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Our results did not support Kohlenstein&#x02019;s early hypothesis that there is a large pulse of females emigrating at 3 years of age and males remain resident throughout their lives [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Here we have shown that very few fish are destined to be resident should they grow into size classes &#x0003e;80 cm TL. Further, multiple studies and approaches now confirm that striped bass are substantially older than 3 years at emigration and, although ocean migrants are dominated by females, this relates to their predominance among large size-classes rather than, say, sex-specific behaviors within size classes. Past studies [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have also failed to detect sex-specific differences in emigration after controlling for size.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Differential mortality</title><p>Striped bass that remained in the Chesapeake Bay had higher mortality rates than those that undertook ocean migrations. The assumption that fall-tagged and released striped bass were resident to the Chesapeake Bay was confirmed through telemetry and conformed to predictions of size-specific emigration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Their small size and age at tagging, indicated over the 1.5 year period that losses were assessed, ocean emigration was unlikely. Although the spring spawning run sample included resident individuals (i.e., those &#x02264; 80 cm TL), a large fraction undertook ocean migrations following release with individuals continuing to recruit to the ocean contingent as they grew. Under the limits of this assumption, the spring-sample mortality rate is likely biased high as it contained some resident individuals. Thus, the nearly two-fold higher mortality rate of the resident group (70.3 36.9% yr<sup>-1</sup>) in comparison to the presumed ocean contingent (36.9% yr<sup>-1</sup>) is likely conservative.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Other migration behaviors</title><p>Differential migration was the dominant, but not exclusive, form of migration plasticity exhibited by study striped bass. A very small minority of &#x0003e;80 cm striped bass (n = 2) resided during summer months in the Chesapeake Bay. The Potomac River population is quite large with the potential for multiple spawning runs [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], trophic partitioning [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and other contingent behaviors that may have not been well represented. Another migration behavior not observed here but well documented is the occurrence of age 1&#x02013;3 striped bass in shelf waters [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

Early research [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] noted high abundances of small striped bass in Southern New England waters and attributed them to strong recruitment years in the Chesapeake Bay. The provenance of young ocean striped bass&#x02014;whether regional spill over from natal systems or the result of longer ocean migrations, remains unknown&#x02013;a topic that would be well engaged through genetic markers or additional telemetry research. Additionally, large aggregations traditionally fished within the nearshore 5-km US state jurisdictional waters [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] have apparently shifted to offshore federal waters causing increased allocation and enforcement challenges [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Migration pathways</title><p>Biotelemetry has allowed us to move beyond the question of whether Potomac River striped bass leave the Chesapeake Bay [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], to where do they go when they leave? All arrows point to Massachusetts. The strong connectivity between large Potomac River spawners and feeding aggregations in nearshore waters off Cape Cod and in Massachusetts Bay is remarkable given that 100% of emigrants wind up here after a rapid directional summer transit. Transit times ranged from 17 to 96 days with a mean of 47 days during springs 2014&#x02013;2018. A complementary biotelemetry study [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] implanted large striped bass in Massachusetts waters and found similar southerly (winter) and northerly (late spring) shelf occurrences in shelf telemetry arrays. Unfortunately, the Chesapeake Bay and southern Mid Atlantic contained few telemetry assets during their study. Still, their conclusion that most of their implanted striped bass originated from Chesapeake waters is well supported by our study.</p><p>Winter migrations were also rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g006">Fig 6</xref>), but the final endpoint in ocean waters (i.e., overwinter habitat) is less certain than the Massachusetts summer feeding habitat. With the deployment of large shelf arrays in DelMarVa near-shelf waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233103.g001">Fig 1</xref>: 2016&#x02013;2018), winter habitats were brought into clearer view. VA shelf waters showed high January-February incidence, and during the winter 2016&#x02013;2017, a warmer year [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>];, high December-January incidences also occurred in Maryland shelf waters. Still, the lack of telemetry assets in North Carolina (NC) shelf waters, a known wintering area for striped bass [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], limit inferences of where Potomac striped bass overwinter. Past genetics [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and conventional tagging data [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] indicate that striped bass from the Chesapeake Bay in recent times have utilized the NC overwintering area. Continued warming of Mid-Atlantic shelf waters [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] could result in greater overwintering off DelMarVa. Still, the NC shelf is also a key wintering-foraging habitat for other oceanic migrating species including sharks, bluefish, weakfish, menhaden, and tunas [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and merits priority in future telemetry studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Straying and skipping</title><p>A fraction of large striped bass were not detected in the Potomac River during the spawning period each year, exhibiting so-called skipped spawning. Skipped spawning (or alternatively, mis-specified reproductive schedules, [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]) can occur owing to energetic constraints and seasonal movements that bypass spawning run behaviors [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. A much higher level of skipped spawning was observed during the first spring after release (2015; 36%) than the subsequent two years (2016&#x02013;2017; 14&#x02013;15%). This could suggest a latent effect of capture, surgery, and release affecting reproduction the subsequent year. On the other hand, we did not observe a similar effect in a past study on spawning run Hudson River striped bass [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Further investigation is warranted to limit telemetry study impacts on subsequent condition and reproduction of large striped bass [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>Straying, incidence during spring in non-natal tributaries, was quite rare for large striped bass. No large fish strayed to tributaries outside the Chesapeake Bay and only two visited non-natal tributaries within the Chesapeake Bay (the adjacent Patuxent and Rappahannock Rivers). These two individuals were detected in spawning areas within the Hudson River during spring. Genetic separation between Hudson and Chesapeake Bay populations [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] suggests that such straying may be uncommon. An interesting possibility, known as adopted migration [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0233103.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] is that these new ocean emigrants may have been susceptible to non-natal migration circuits, adopting those of Hudson River striped bass through population overlap and social interactions in shelf waters.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Management implications of differential migration</title><p>Ocean emigration by striped bass continues to challenge fishers in their pursuit and fishery managers in their assessment of how source populations contribute to shelf fisheries. Ocean fisheries are assessed and managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) using a Statistical Catch at Age model comprised of two &#x0201c;fleets,&#x0201d; one focused on the commercial fisheries of the Chesapeake Bay and the second on recreational ocean fisheries. Consideration of fleet behaviors is important owing to differing selectivity patterns between recreational (selection for large sizes) and commercial (selection for intermediate sizes) fisheries. Further specification of population-specific behaviors by Chesapeake Bay striped bass was pursued in a two-stock model (Chesapeake Bay population v. everything else) in the most recent assessment [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but did not pass peer review, owing in part to uncertainty in the population&#x02019;s contribution to ocean fisheries and whether size at emigration has changed through time [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Because we observed similar TL<sub>50</sub> levels as past studies by Dorazio et al. [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Secor and Piccoli [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we infer that size at emigration for Chesapeake Bay striped bass has been stable in recent decades. This supports a key assumption of the ASMFC&#x02019;s spatially explicit stock assessment, one that specifies differential migration and holds considerable advantage in specifying the productivity of estuarine and ocean segments of the fishery to better support regional allocation tactics.</p><p>Emigration by striped bass, referenced here as differential migration, represents a type of partial migration, influencing population production, resilience, and stability. Spatial buffering against regional differences in exploitation, pollution, and food web conditions can occur when contingents within populations vary in their migration patterns as documented here for striped bass. Indeed, the dramatic recovery of striped bass in the 1990s was largely due to differential migration, which allowed escapement of large ocean striped bass (i.e., facilitated differential migration) from extremely intense fisheries on smaller individuals within the Chesapeake Bay [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Thus, partial migration controls have been implicit in past key management tactics. Further, differential migration by striped bass defines the role that they play in estuarine and shelf food webs as forage demands are strongly size-dependent. For the year 2017, the ASMFC assessed a high total natural mortality rate: 64% for resident Chesapeake Bay striped bass based on a tagging study [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This mortality was attributed to disease (<italic>Mycobacteriosis spp</italic>.) prevalence, although estimates of fishing mortality are uncertain owing to hook and release mortality [<xref rid="pone.0233103.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The assessed mortality level is similar to transmitter loss observed in our study (70% yr<sup>-1</sup>). Total mortality for the ocean contingent of Chesapeake Bay striped bass estimated by the ASMFC was 36% yr<sup>-1</sup>, which was also similar to transmitter loss levels for this population segment (40%). Thus, the capacity of differential migration to contribute to stability in the overall population and to convey key trophic roles across its range will have much to do with managing exploitation and other sources of mortality in both the Chesapeake Bay and shelf regions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study design benefitted from comments made by the ASMFC Striped Bass Technical Committee.

These include John Chisholm, Bill Hoffman, and Nicholas Buchan (Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries); Eric Thadey, (Washington DC Department of the Environment); Robert Aguilar and Matt Ogburn (Smithsonian Environmental Research Center); Chris Hager (Chesapeake Scientific); Matt Fisher and Pat McGrath (Virginia Institute of Marine Science); Jeff Kneebone (Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life); Megan Winton (Atlantic White Shark Conservancy); Evan Ingram, Sara Cernadas-Martin, Keith Dunton and Mike Frisk (Stony Brook University); Danielle Haulsee and Matt Oliver (University of Delaware); Aaron Bunch (Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries); Chris Conroy (Northeastern University); Brian Dresser (Tetra Tech); Hannah Schmidt (US Army); James Hawkes (NOAA Maine Field Office); Amanda Higgs and Jessica Best (NY State Department of Environmental Conservation); and Justin Krebs (AKRF, Inc). Ms. Ella Rothermel and Ms. Caroline Wiernicki assisted with striped bass surgical implantations. Mr. Chuck Stence (Maryland Department of Natural Resources) assisted with telemetry receiver deployments in the upper Chesapeake Bay.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0233103.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cadrin</surname><given-names>SX</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Secor</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name>. <article-title>The role of spatial dynamics in the stability, resilience, and productivity of an estuarine fish population.</article-title>
