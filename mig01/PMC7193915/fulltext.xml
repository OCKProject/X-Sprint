However, it is not clear whether AUY922 affects events in vascular diseases. We investigated the effects of AUY922 on the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-stimulated proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). VSMC viability was detected using the XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-<italic>2H</italic>-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) reagent. To detect the attenuating effects of AUY922 on PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs migration <italic>in vitro</italic>, we performed the Boyden chamber and scratch wound healing assays. To identify AUY922-mediated changes in the signaling pathway, the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was analyzed by immunoblotting. The inhibitory effects of AUY922 on migration and proliferation <italic>ex vivo</italic> were tested using an aortic ring assay. AUY922 was not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 5 nM. PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation, migration, and sprout outgrowth were significantly decreased by AUY922 in a dose-dependent manner. AUY922 significantly reduced the PDGF-BB-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Furthermore, PD98059 (a selective ERK1/2 inhibitor) and LY294002 (a selective Akt inhibitor) decreased VSMC migration and proliferation by inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Greater attenuation of PDGF-BB-induced cell viability and migration was observed upon treatment with PD98059 or LY294002 in combination with AUY922. AUY922 showed anti-proliferation and anti-migration effects towards PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs by regulating the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Thus, AUY922 is a candidate for the treatment of atherosclerosis and restenosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Atherosclerosis</kwd><kwd>AUY922</kwd><kwd>Heat shock protein 90</kwd><kwd>Platelet-derived growth factor</kwd><kwd>Vascular disease</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke, are disorders of the blood vessels and among the leading causes of death in industrialized and developing countries because of increases in westernized eating habits [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The etiology of cardiovascular diseases, accepted until recently as an etiological hypothesis with evidence-based anatomical analysis, involves the formation of narrow blood vessels after endothelial dysfunction caused by inflammatory lesions [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In particular, abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation contributes to the poor prognosis of patients after treatment with angioplasty and stents [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Diverse non-clinical trials have reported that controlling abnormal VSMC migration and hyper-proliferation, which narrows the vascular wall, is a powerful strategy for inhibiting vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and restenosis [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The proliferation of VSMCs is regulated by autocrine and paracrine growth factors, which are secreted by numerous cell types, such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB is a representative growth factor that leads to the mitogens and chemoattractants of VSMCs [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PDGF-BB initiates cell division signals through autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in PDGF-receptors (PDGFR) and activates multiple signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases pathways [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly, previous studies have showed that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone protein, is associated with the regulation of PDGF signaling, such as protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Blocking or regulating PDGF-BB signaling and associated receptors is a potential approach to delay the progression of diseases involving the blood vessels or vascular system [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>HSP90 expression is increased in human atherosclerotic plaques [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; some studies have showed that HSP90 inhibition can improve vascular disease via the suppression of VSMC migration and proliferation [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. AUY922, also known as luminespib, is an HSP90 inhibitor that effectively inhibits the division of various tumor cells by inhibiting chaperone functions [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. AUY922 inhibits cell growth and proliferation by considerably decreasing PI3-kinase and MAP kinases in HER2-positive breast cancer [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the effect of AUY922 on PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether AUY922 can inhibit the responses of PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs. We found that AUY922 attenuates PDGF-BB-induced migration and proliferation in VSMCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>AUY922 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA).

In this study, we demonstrated that AUY922, an HSP90 inhibitor, inhibits PDGF-BB-induced increases in VSMC migration and proliferation. Moreover, AUY922 significantly reduced ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation in response to PDGF-BB stimulation in VSMCs. Collectively, these findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of AUY922 on HSP90 modulates downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK and Akt, to regulate PDGF-BB-induced VSMC migration and proliferation.</p><p>Excessive migration and proliferation of VSMCs by PDGF-BB have been implicated in neointima formation in atherosclerosis and restenosis development [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. PDGF-BB induces the phosphorylation of PDGFR and abnormal migration and proliferation of VSMCs [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, controlling PDGFR phosphorylation and downstream signaling pathways may be a valuable strategy to treat vascular disorders [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Heat shock proteins are chaperone molecules that facilitate normal protein functions by controlling the folding of intercellular proteins and preventing the misfolding of newly synthesized proteins [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In particular, HSP90 client proteins are associated with various oncogenes, transcription factors, and steroid hormone receptors, suggesting that heat shock proteins are therapeutic targets [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. AUY922 reduces the activation of oncogenic receptors, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), and PDGFR in a variety of cancer cells [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our study, AUY922 significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Therefore, we predicted that AUY922 may exert therapeutic effects in PDGF-BB-induced vascular disease via the inhibition of signaling pathways downstream of PDGFR.</p><p>To evaluate this hypothesis, we focused on the regulation of Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. HSP90 strongly contribute to signaling cascades in PDGF/PDGFR. PDGF-BB activates PDGFR and downstream signaling molecules, such as Akt and ERK1/2 [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some studies have reported that PDGF-BB is closely related to the excessive proliferation and migration of VSMCs via Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. LY294002 (a selective Akt inhibitor) and PD98059 (a selective MAPK inhibitor) have anti-proliferation and anti-chemoattractant effects in PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Our data also showed that the inhibitory effects of LY294002 or AUY922 on PDGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, and treatment with PD98059 or AUY922 efficiently downregulated the PDGF-BB-mediated overexpression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the inhibitory effect indicated that AUY922 greater than PD98059 or LY294002 in the PDGF-BB-induced migration and proliferation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that HSP90 inhibitors have potential therapeutic effects against vascular disorders, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis.</p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important intermediates in normal aerobic cell metabolism; however, excessive oxidative stress can promote or interfere with physiological function [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, PDGF-BB generates the oxidative stress and the secreted oxidative stressed factors, underlying HSP90 [<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. PDGF-BB-induced ROS can induce the abnormal VSMC migration and proliferation through regulating the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Oliveira <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] reported that LY294002 can regulate to reduce ROS generation. Furthermore, Nguyen Thi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported the PD98059 induced the antioxidant enzyme such as superoxide dismutase. Our results showed that LY294002 partially inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation and PD98059 slightly downregulates Akt phosphorylation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). However, AUY922 significantly regulates the PDGF-BB-induced the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Therefore, AUY922 directly or indirectly regulates PDGF-BB-induced ROS or oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes. However, further studies are needed to clarify the effects of HSP90 inhibitors on ROS generation in PDGF-BB-stimulated VSMCs.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that AUY922 inhibits migration, proliferation, and the phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt in VSMCs in response to PDGF-BB. Additionally, AUY922 attenuated PDGF-BB-induced aortic sprout outgrowth. Therefore, AUY922, as an HSP90 inhibitor, is promising for the prevention of restenosis and atherosclerosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This paper was supported by the KU Research Professor Program of Konkuk University, the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2018R1D1A1A02085705), the Radiation Technology R&#x00026;D program through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2017M2A2A6A01070927) and the Korea Health Technology R&#x00026;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) funded by the Ministry of Health &#x00026; Welfare (HI18C2383), Republic of Korea.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions:</bold> J.S.K. and K.P.L. contributed equally to the experimental design and performed the experiment.
