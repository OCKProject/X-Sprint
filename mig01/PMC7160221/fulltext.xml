The expression of miR-92 and neogenin was evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The migration and invasion abilities were examined by transwell assays. The interaction between miR-92 and neogenin was conducted by dual-luciferase reporter system. As a result, we found that the expression of miR-92 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Down-regulation of miR-92 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted cell apoptosis rate of U251 and U87 cells. Notably, miR-92 was identified to directly target to 3&#x02019;-UTR of neogenin. Furthermore, neogenin was down-regulated in glioma tissues and cells in a miR-92-correlated manner. Overexpression of neigenin could cause similar results to miR-92 knockdown in U251 and U87 cells. However, the silencing of neogenin partially reversed the effects of miR-92 knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of glioma cells in vitro. In conclusion, we clarified that miR-92 knockdown could suppress the malignant progression of glioma cells in vitro by targeting neogenin. Therefore, miR-92 could serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in glioma patients</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Glioma</kwd><kwd>miR-92</kwd><kwd>neogenin</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="j_med-2020-0040_s_001"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Glioma is one of the most aggressive malignant tumors occurring in the central nervous system with high mortality, and accounts for over half of brain tumors [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

Therefore, research on the molecular mechanism of glioma origination and progression is urgently needed, and could provide potential prognostic and therapeutic targets.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNA molecules with 18-23 nucleotides, act as either oncogenes or suppressors to mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing, and to further regulate tumor progression by binding to their target genes [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For instance, the overexpression of miRNA (miR)-20a was reported to promote cell proliferation in anaplastic thyroid cancer by targeting CELF2 [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Meanwhile, miR-139 was low-expressed, and inhibited liver cell growth and metastasis through targeting CXCR4 [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. miR-92, one member of the widely-known oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster, has been identified to promote cell proliferation in many tumors, like lymphoma, breast cancer and lung cancer [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Ada Sacchi&#x02019;s group also discovered that miR-92 increased myeloid cell proliferation and inhibited cell death by targeting p63 abundance and modulating isoforms [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the biological role and regulatory mechanism of miR-92 in glioma remain largely elusive.</p><p>Neogenin, receptor of various ligands (netrins, secreted protein, bone morphogenetic proteins, etc.), functions in neuropathic detection, ion mediation and embryonic development regulation [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Notably, neogenin is involved in multiple brain diseases, like Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and glioma, since it participates in cellular axon guidance, trophectoderm differentiation and neuronal regulation [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, neogenin has the capacity to active cell death pathway and modulate cell migration through the consumption of netrin, thus the dysregulation of neogenin has been reported in many primary tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma, breast cancer and gloima. Previous reports demonstrated that the low expression of neogenin in glioma induced promoter methylation and accelerated glioma progression [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, it is still unclear whether the regulation of neogenin is executed by binding to miR-92.</p><p>In our study, we explored the dysregulation and role of miR-92 and neogenin in glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in vitro, as well as confirmed the interaction between both. Furthermore, we clarified a regulatory mechanism of miR-92/neogenin axis in glioma progression, and suggested miR-92 could serve as a potential biomarker for the treatment of glioma.</p></sec><sec id="j_med-2020-0040_s_002"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="j_med-2020-0040_s_002_s_001"><label>2.1</label><title>Tissue samples</title><p>A total of 32 primary glioma patients were recruited from the Cangzhou Central Hospital.

However, the upregulation of neogenin was significantly abolished by si-Neogenin. MTT and flow cytometry results exhibited the up-regulation of neogenin correlating with lower cell proliferation and a higher apoptosis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="j_med-2020-0040_fig_005">Fig.5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="j_med-2020-0040_fig_005">5C)</xref>. Similarly, the migratory and invasive cells were dramatically decreased in U251 and U87 cells when neogenin was highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="j_med-2020-0040_fig_005">Fig.5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="j_med-2020-0040_fig_005">5E)</xref>. Therefore, we concluded that neogenin upregulation could mediate the effects of miR-92 knockout on glioma cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion.</p><fig id="j_med-2020-0040_fig_005" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Neogenin upregulation mediated the protective effect of miR-92 on glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

It is well-documented that miRNA is capable of altering cellular metabolism by targeting a specific gene and further regulating its post-transcription [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Besides, miRNA is essential in modulating cellular signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation, thereby the disturbance of miRNA can induce malignancies [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The discovery of certain miRNA can serve as diagnostic, prognostic markers and potential therapeutic targets in different tumorigenesis. Wei et al. found that the miR-509-3p level was up-regulated while the MAP3K8 level was down-regulated in polycystic ovary syndrome, and the interaction between miR-509-3p and MAP3K8 displayed instructional significance on regulating oestradiol production [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Accumulating evidence has identified that miRNAs are closely related with the regulatory network of brain cancer, for instance, miR-140-5p functioned as a suppressor to inhibit glioma cell proliferation and invasion whereas miR-363 displayed the opposite regulatory effects as oncogene [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In our research, we have suggested that the up-regulation of miR-92/neogenin axis could contribute to glioma cell progression <italic>in vitro</italic> as evidenced by several findings. First of all, the expression level of miR-92 was largely up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines compared with the adjacent normal tissue and NHA, respectively. Furthermore, the elimination of miR-92 restricted cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and enhanced cell apoptosis inU251 and U87 cells. To expound the underlying molecular mechanism of miR-92 on glioma tumorigenesis and development, bioinformatics analysis online database TargetScan was recruited to predict the target gene, then we discovered miR-92 could bind to 3&#x02019;-UTR neogenin specifically.</p><p>Neogenin, also known as a tumor suppressor protein Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), is low-expressed in many cancers, and this deficiency of neogenin increases the risk of tumor malignancy [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that an over-expression of neogenin could mitigate cell proliferation and induce programmed cell death; however, the deletion of neogenin showed the opposite effects [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The role of neogenin relies on the ligand that binds to neogenin. For example, neogenin boosted cell adhesion when it bound to netrin; while neogenin stooged chemorepellant for cells when it was bound to repulsive guidance molecules. In cancers, neogenin exerts its biological activities through different mechanisms. Wei et al. proved that neogenin overexpression inhibited BMP-2-induced phosphorylation, thereby accelerating cell progression and reducing cell apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Inversely, Xueping Wang&#x02019;s group observed that neogenin is over-expressed in gastric cancer, and neogenin could promote gastric cell adhesion by activating the Rac1/PI3K/AKT pathway [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To clarify whether neogenin could affect glioma cells positively or negatively, we detected the expression levels of neogenin mRNA and protein by qRT-PCR and western blot, then a reduction of the expression of both neogenin mRNA and protein was observed. In addition, the existence of neogenin inhibited cell growth, migration and invasion, as well as increased the apoptosis rate in glioma cells.</p><p>The main findings of our study include the following aspects. Firstly, excessive expression of miR-92 was detected in glioma tissue and cell lines. Nevertheless, miR-92 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but increased the apoptosis rate in U251 and U87 cells, indicating miR-92 might play positive regulatory effects on glioma cell progression. According to bioinformatics prediction, there was a specific binding site between miR-92 and neogenin. Subsequently, we certified that miR-92 was inversely correlated with neogenin (R2=0.743, P&#x0ff1c;0.01). Moreover, neogenin significantly inhibited cell growth and induced cell apoptosis by activating the cell death pathway, which was consistent with the previous report [<xref rid="j_med-2020-0040_ref_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In order to confirm the regulatory effects of miR-92 and neogenin on glioma cells, we constructed anti-NC, anti-miR-92, anti-miR-92+siRNA and anti-miR-92+si-neogenin transfected glioma cells. The results showed that miR-92 knockout enhanced neogenin expression and further inhibited cell progression, whereas neogenin silence by transfection could rescue miR-92 knockdown-induced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Collectively, our data demonstrated that miR-92 could regulate glioma cell progression by targeting neogenin.</p></sec><sec id="j_med-2020-0040_s_005"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results identified that miR-92 is a critical oncogene and plays an essential role in glioma cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that miR-92 has been discovered to alter glioma cell progression by directly targeting neogenin. The inhibition of miR-92 simultaneously up-regulated the neogenin protein expression level. Additionally, neogenin silence attenuated miR-92 mediated cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Therefore, miR-92 could serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in glioma patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack
