    "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a chemokine that plays an essential role in immune system function. Previous studies suggested that MIF protects neurons in ischemic conditions. However, few studies are reported on the role of MIF in neurological recovery after ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection mediated by MIF. Human neuroblastoma cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 hours and then returned to normal aerobic environment for reperfusion (OGD/R). 30 ng/mL MIF recombinant (30 ng/mL) or ISO-1 (MIF antagonist; 50 Î¼M) was administered to human neuroblastoma cells. Then cell cultures were assigned to one of four groups: control, OGD/R, OGD/R with MIF, OGD/R with ISO-1. Cell viability was analyzed using WST-1 assay. Expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), Caspase-3, Bcl2, and Bax were detected by western blot assay and immunocytochemistry in each group to measure apoptotic activity. WST-1 assay results revealed that compared to the OGD/R group, cell survival rate was significantly higher in the OGD/R with MIF group and lower in the OGD/R with ISO-1 group. Western blot assay and immunocytochemistry results revealed that expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2, and MAP2 were significantly higher, and expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly lower in the MIF group than in the OGD/R group. Expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2, and MAP2 were significantly lower, and expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly higher in the ISO-1 group than in the OGD/R group. MIF administration promoted neuronal cell survival and induced high expression levels of BDNF, MAP2, and Bcl2 (anti-apoptosis) and low expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax (pro-apoptosis) in an OGD/R model. These results suggest that MIF administration is effective for inducing expression of BDNF and leads to neuroprotection of neuronal cells against hypoxic injury."
