From these assays emerged two novel compounds, namely 11 and 20, which with an IC50 respectively of 1.6 and 1.8 µM are the most potent inhibitors of DGKα discovered to date. Both compounds demonstrated the ability to restore apoptosis in a cellular model of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease as well as the capacity to reduce the migration of cancer cells, suggesting their potential utility in preventing metastasis. Finally, relying on experimental biological data, molecular modelling studies allow us to set a three-point pharmacophore model for DGK inhibitors.">

The approach consists of isolating tumor-derived components, such as circulating tumour cells (CTC), tumour cell-free DNA (ctDNA), and extracellular vesicles (EVs), from the patient peripheral blood fluids. These elements constitute a source of genomic and proteomic information for cancer treatment. Within the tumour-derived components of the body fluids, the enzyme indicated with the acronym CA IX and belonging to the superfamily of carbonic anhydrases (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) is a promising aspirant for checking tumours. CA IX is a transmembrane-CA isoform that is strongly overexpressed in many cancers being not much diffused in healthy tissues except the gastrointestinal tract. Here, it is summarised the role of CA IX as tumour-associated protein and its putative relationship in liquid biopsyfor diagnosing and monitoring cancer progression.">

The NAT1 gene was deleted in MDA-MB-231, HT-29 and HeLa cells using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Loss of NAT1 increased adherence to collagen in all three cell-lines but migration was unaffected. NAT1 deletion decreased invasion and induced changes to cell morphology. These effects were independent of matrix metalloproteinases but were related to integrin ITGαV expression.

The peptide T7-modified polypeptide nanoparticles for delivery DNA (CRD-PEG-T7/pPMEPA1) was prepared as our previous study. However, the feasibility of CRD-PEG-T7/pPMEPA1 for BMPCa treatment, the mechanisms underlying cellular uptake, anti-BMPCa effect, and administration safety requires further research. LNCaP cells treated with endocytosis inhibitors and excessive T7 under different culture condition were carried out to investigate the mechanisms of cellular uptake of the CRD-PEG-T7-pPMEPA1. A transwell assay was applied to evaluate the cell migration ability. Besides, the tumor volume and survival rates of the PCa xenograft mice model were recorded to estimate the anti-tumor effect. In addition, the weight profiles of the PCa tumor-bearing mice, the blood chemistry, and the HE analysis of visceral organs and tumor was conducted to investigate the administration safety of CRD-PEG-T7/pPMEPA1. The results showed that PCa cellular uptake was decreased after treating with excessive free T7, endocytosis inhibitors and lower incubation temperature. Besides, CRD-PEG-T7/pPMEPA1 could inhibit the LNCaP cells chemotaxis and tumor growth. In addition, the survival duration of the PCa tumor-bearing mice treating with CRD-PEG-T7/pPMEPA1 was significantly prolonged with any systemic toxicity or damage to the organs. In conclusion, this research proposes a promising stratagem for treatment BMPCa by providing the biocompatible and effective carrier for delivery DNA therapeutic agents.">

        <span class="abst" title="Small interfering RNA (siRNA) exhibits great potential as a novel therapeutic option due to its highly sequence-specific ability to silence genes. However, efficient and safe delivery carriers are required for developing novel therapeutic paradigms. Thus, the successful development of efficient delivery platforms for siRNA is a crucial issue for the development of siRNA-based drugs in cancer treatments. In this study, biocompatible selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were loaded with RGDfC peptide to fabricate tumor-targeting gene delivery vehicle RGDfC-SeNPs. Subsequently, RGDfC-SeNPs were loaded with Derlin1-siRNA to fabricate RGDfC-Se@siRNA, which are functionalized selenium nanoparticles. RGDfC-Se@siRNA showed greater uptake in HeLa cervical cancer cells in comparison with that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), verifying the RGDfC-mediated specific uptake of RGDfC-Se@siRNA. RGDfC-Se@siRNA was capable of entering HeLa cells via clathrin-associated endocytosis, and showed faster siRNA release in a cancer cell microenvironment in comparison with a normal physiological environment. qPCR and western blotting assays both indicated that RGDfC-Se@siRNA exhibited an obvious gene silencing efficacy in HeLa cells. RGDfC-Se@siRNA suppressed the invasion, migration and the proliferation of HeLa cells, and triggered HeLa cell apoptosis. Moreover, RGDfC-Se@siRNA induced the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potentials. Meanwhile, RGDfC-Se@siRNA enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HeLa cell, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction mediated by ROS might play a significant role in RGDfC-Se@siRNA-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, RGDfC-SeNPs@siRNA exhibited significant antitumor activity in a HeLa tumor-bearing mouse model. Additionally, RGDfC-SeNPs@siRNA is nontoxic to main organ of mouse. The above results indicate that RGDfC-Se@siRNA provides a promising potential for cervical cancer therapy.">

Interestingly, under the given frequency stress, the groove structure strengthened the above characteristics of fibroblasts beyond adhesion, and promoted differentiation of BMSCs into myofibroblasts. The above results indicate that 0.6 Hz may improve the implant-tissue sealing, while 1.0-Hz stress probably causes the disordered fiber deposition around implants.">

The current stent materials and placement methods have several limitations. This study attempts to provide an alternative by investigating ureteral anastomosis with a polyimide stent and a modified placement method in a rat model of kidney transplantation.Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Group I: sham operation, Group II: autologous ureteral anastomosis, and Group III: isogenic kidney transplantation with ureteral anastomosis. For the anastomosis, a polyimide stent with a previously placed 11-0 silk was inserted into the ureter. The stent and ureter were fixed with 11-0 silk sutures. The kidney weight and serum creatinine were recorded. The ureteral and renal sections were taken for histological analysis.Results: None of the stents had migrated. Urethral patency was achieved. Further, there were no evident histological changes in the anastomosed ureters. The serum creatinine level in group III was significantly higher than the other two groups, but there was no significant difference in kidney weight among the groups at postoperative week 12. Finally, the histological structure of kidneys in groups II and III only showed minor changes.Conclusions: The current anastomosis method with polyimide stent causes minimal damage to the ureteral walls and minimizes the possibility of stent migration. Therefore, this method of ureteral anastomosis with the polyimide stent should be explored for its potential benefits in more animal kidney transplantation models, thus providing an alternative for the clinical setting.">

        <span class="abst" title="c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling regulates both cancer cell apoptosis and survival. Emerging evidence show that JNK promoted tumour progression is involved in various cancers, that include human pancreatic-, lung-, and breast cancer. The pro-survival JNK oncoprotein functions in a cell context- and cell type-specific manner to affect signal pathways that modulate tumour initiation, proliferation, and migration. JNK is therefore considered a potential oncogenic target for cancer therapy. Currently, designing effective and specific JNK inhibitors is an active area in the cancer treatment. Some ATP-competitive inhibitors of JNK, such as SP600125 and AS601245, are widely used in vitro; however, this type of inhibitor lacks specificity as they indiscriminately inhibit phosphorylation of all JNK substrates. Moreover, JNK has at least three isoforms with different functions in cancer development and identifying specific selective inhibitors is crucial for the development of targeted therapy in cancer. Some selective inhibitors of JNK are identified; however, their clinical studies in cancer are relatively less conducted. In this review, we first summarised the function of JNK signalling in cancer progression; there is a focus on the discussion of the novel selective JNK inhibitors as potential targeting therapy in cancer. Finally, we have offered a future perspective of the selective JNK inhibitors in the context of cancer therapies. We hope this review will help to further understand the role of JNK in cancer progression and provide insight into the design of novel selective JNK inhibitors in cancer treatment.">

This qualitative study explores the influence of family dynamics on adolescents sexual risk behaviour within a migration affected community.Method: Using thematic analysis, we processed data collected from 13 adolescents and 10 parents.Results: The themes generated from our data include the following, &quot;Household poverty&quot;, &quot;Family conflicts&quot;, &quot;Lack of discipline&quot;, &quot;Parent-child closeness&quot;, &quot;Generational gap between adolescents and their parents&quot; and &quot;Lack of sex education&quot;. Our study found that financial constrain was a major problem in this community, the impact of this was worse felt among adolescents who lived by themselves. In addition, some parents were delinquent, distant or detached from their adolescents. We also found evidence to suggest that couple conflict was a common occurrence, and this had negative influence on adolescent well-being and there sexual behaviour.Conclusion: In view of the deepening crisis of early sexual engagement among adolescents and the accompanying risk of unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, it is imperative to foster adolescent friendly households where the parents/caregivers are empowered to support their adolescents.">

        <span class="abst" title="Celastrol, a Chinese herbal medicine, has already shown an inhibition effect on retinoblastoma growth activity in our previous research, but its mechanism is not well understood. Angiogenesis is a main driving force in many tumors. Here, we studied whether celastrol could inhibit angiogenesis-mediated retinoblastoma growth, if so, through what mechanism. In this work, we developed celastrol-loaded polymeric nanomicelles to improve the poor water solubility of celastrol. When given an intraperitoneal injection to mice bearing human retinoblastoma xenografts, celastrol nanomicelles (CNMs, 27.2 mg/kg/2 days) significantly reduced the weight and the volume of tumors and decreased tumor angiogenesis. We found that CNMs suppressed hypoxia-induced proliferation, migration, and invasion by human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (EA.hy 926) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, CNMs inhibited SO-Rb 50 cells-induced sprouting of the vessels and vascular formation in chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay in vitro. To understand the molecular mechanism of these activities, we assessed the signaling pathways in CoCl2 treated EA.hy 926. CNMs inhibited the hypoxia-induced HIF-1α and VEGF. In conclusion, our results reveal that CNMs target the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway, which may be an important reason for the suppression of retinoblastoma growth and angiogenesis.">

Therefore, how to safely deliver the miRNAs to the targeted site of action is the most pivotal step to achieve the ideal treatment effect. In the present work, the miR-128-3p, which is able of inducing chromosomal instability, was loaded into the nanocomplexes developed by the PEG-PDMAEMA (PDMAEMA-NP). By this way, the miR-128-3p was shielded from exposure to various degrading enzymes in bloodstream. Additionally, the PEGylation endowed the PDMAEMA-NP with long time of circulation as demonstrated in vivo by pharmacokinetics investigation. To target and deliver the miR-128-3p to the site of action, a tumor-homing peptide CPKSNNGVC, which specifically targets the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), was decorated on the surface of PDMAEMA-NP. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that more efficient delivery of miR-128-3p to cells or tumor tissues was obtained by the PDMAEMA-NP than plasmid. Additionally, modification of C peptides further enhanced the tumor accumulation of miR-128-3p, and in turn contributed to the stronger tumor growth inhibition effect. Underlying mechanisms study revealed that the miR-128-3p inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and progress of CRC tissues through silence of the activity of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathway. By this way, the chemotherapy effect of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) was dramatically improved after co-treating the cells with miR-128-3p formulations.">

Previous studies suggested that MIF protects neurons in ischemic conditions. However, few studies are reported on the role of MIF in neurological recovery after ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study is to identify the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection mediated by MIF. Human neuroblastoma cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 4 hours and then returned to normal aerobic environment for reperfusion (OGD/R). 30 ng/mL MIF recombinant (30 ng/mL) or ISO-1 (MIF antagonist; 50 μM) was administered to human neuroblastoma cells. Then cell cultures were assigned to one of four groups: control, OGD/R, OGD/R with MIF, OGD/R with ISO-1. Cell viability was analyzed using WST-1 assay. Expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), Caspase-3, Bcl2, and Bax were detected by western blot assay and immunocytochemistry in each group to measure apoptotic activity. WST-1 assay results revealed that compared to the OGD/R group, cell survival rate was significantly higher in the OGD/R with MIF group and lower in the OGD/R with ISO-1 group. Western blot assay and immunocytochemistry results revealed that expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2, and MAP2 were significantly higher, and expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly lower in the MIF group than in the OGD/R group. Expression levels of BDNF, Bcl2, and MAP2 were significantly lower, and expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax were significantly higher in the ISO-1 group than in the OGD/R group. MIF administration promoted neuronal cell survival and induced high expression levels of BDNF, MAP2, and Bcl2 (anti-apoptosis) and low expression levels of Caspase-3 and Bax (pro-apoptosis) in an OGD/R model. These results suggest that MIF administration is effective for inducing expression of BDNF and leads to neuroprotection of neuronal cells against hypoxic injury.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The migration of Caribbean nurses, particularly to developed countries such as Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom, remains a matter of concern for most countries of the region. With nursing vacancy rates averaging 40%, individual countries and the region collectively are challenged to address this issue through the development and implementation of sustainable, feasible strategies. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the amount, type, sources, distribution, and focus of the conceptual and empirical literature on the migration of Caribbean nurses, and to identify gaps in the literature. METHODS:Identified records were selected and reviewed using Arksey and O'Malley's scoping framework. A comprehensive search was conducted of eight electronic databases and the Google search engine. Findings were summarized numerically and thematically, with themes emerging through an iterative, inductive process. RESULTS:Much of the literature included in our study (N = 6, 33%) originated in the United States. Publications steadily increased between 2003 and 2016, and half of them (N = 9) were journal articles. Many (N = 6, 33%) of the records used quantitative methods. The themes identified were as follows: (1) migration patterns and trends; (2) post-migration experiences; (3) past and present, policies, programs, and practices; and (4) consequences of migration to donor countries. More than half (N = 11, 56%) of the literature addressed nurse migration policies, programs, or practices, either solely or in part. Several gaps were identified including the need for evaluation of the effectiveness of current nurse migration management strategies and to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries. CONCLUSION:This review demonstrates the need for future research in key areas such as the impact of nurse migration on health systems and population health. The literature tends to focus on Caribbean countries with higher levels of nurse migration. However, data regarding this phenomenon in other Caribbean countries is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the plight of the Caribbean region and would answer the call from the International Organization for Migration to study policies, trends, and impacts in understudied Caribbean countries.">

We developed high-content microscopy, high-throughput functional screens for migration and morphology in PCa cells using a microRNA library. RNA-Seq analysis of paired epithelial and mesenchymal PCa cells identified differential expression of 200 microRNAs. Data integration identified two microRNAs that inhibited migration, induced an epithelial-like morphology and were increased in epithelial PCa cells. An overrepresentation of the AAGUGC seed sequence was detected in all three datasets. Analysis of published datasets of patients with PCa identified microRNAs of clinical relevance. The integration of high-throughput functional and expression analyses identifies microRNAs with clinical significance that modulate metastatic behavior in PCa.">

        <span class="abst" title="Adolescent girls in West Africa are migrating in search of educational and livelihood opportunities. In Mali, early marriage (before the legal age of 16) is a common practice. This paper builds on prior research on female migration that focused on the direct influences of migration on marriage and explores the wider social impact of rising female migration in sending communities by examining direct and indirect effects and intended and unintended consequences. This study examines perceptions about migration among girls and their parents including how it influences marital timing, marriage preparations, marriage practices, and marital relations. Qualitative data were collected from 140 adolescent girls and 115 parents of adolescent girls in rural areas in focus group discussions (FGDs) (n = 31) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) (n = 41) to inform how girls' migration patterns might influence program recruitment strategies and content for an intervention aimed at addressing early marriage in Mali. Our findings concur with earlier studies that migration has direct effects on marriage because it allows girls to both avoid early marriage and prepare for marriage through the assembly of goods and wares to bring to their conjugal homes. Despite some of the perceived risks of migration on marriage, the indirect effects of migration include allowing girls to see different types of marriage practices and marital relationships between husbands and wives and potentially allowing migrant girls to exert more influence over the marital process compared to non-migrants. However, migration can expose girls to new ideas and alternatives that may be incongruent with cultural expectations for them once they return to their communities. This study suggests that migration is seen as an inevitable part of life for many adolescent girls in Mali. Girls who migrate may return to their villages with not only items or income that provide direct benefits to a marriage, but also viewpoints on the expectations for women and girls in their communities that indirectly influence marital relationships. Although this can be challenging for individual returned girls in terms of reintegration, these new expectations may, over time, lead to social changes that influence migrants and non-migrants. Program strategies and approaches must consider the possibility of migration as an important aspect of every adolescent girl's opportunity structure. The qualitative data suggests that certain skills are critical for adolescent girls. Programs should emphasize the acquisition of relevant skills such as communication, risk assessment, negotiation and money management in ways that are relevant for migrants and non-migrants.">

Furthermore, the enhanced expression of miR-520b could inhibit liver cancer cell migration, while silencing its expression resulted in increased migration. Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) was identified as a direct and functional new target of miR-520b. This regulation was also confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. In addition, our results showed that overexpression of the MLK3 expression partially reversed the effect of miR-520b on liver cancer cell migration, indicating that MLK3 contributes to the migration in liver cancer.

However, the role of MACF1 on preosteoblast migration is not clear. Here, by using MACF1 knockdown and overexpressed MC3T3-E1 cells, we found MACF1 positively regulated preosteoblast migration induced by cell polarization. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining showed that MACF1 increased end-binding protein (EB1) distribution on microtubule (MT), and decreased EB1 distribution on focal adhesion (FA) complex. Moreover, upregulation of MACF1 activated Src level and enhanced the colocalization of EB1 with activated Src. In addition, MACF1 diminished colocalization of EB1 with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which induced EB1 release from FA and promoted FA turnover. These results indicated an important role and mechanism of MACF1 in regulating preosteoblast migration through promoting FA turnover by mediating EB1 colocalization with Src and APC, which inferred that MACF1 might be a potential target for preventing and treating bone disorders.">

The mechanisms underlying proliferation and differentiation of MSCs have been studied. However, much less is known about the mechanisms regulating the migration of MSCs. Platelet lysate (PL), a supplement used to promote cell expansion, has been shown to promote MSCs migration; however, the underlying mechanism are unknown. Here, by using adipose-derived rat MSCs (rMSCs) and the scratch assay in the absence and presence of various BK channels modulators, we evaluated the role of BK channels in mediating the PL-stimulated migration of rMSCs. We found that 5% PL increased rMSCs migration, and this effect was blocked by the addition of the BK channel selective antagonist Iberiotoxin (IBTX). In the absence of PL, the BK channel agonist NS1619, stimulated rMSCs migration to similar level as 5% PL. Addition of both NS1619 and 5% PL resulted in an increase in rMSCs migration, that was higher than when either one was added individually. From whole-cell recordings, it was found that the addition of 5% PL increased the magnitude of BK current density. By using Western blot and flow cytometry, it was found that PL did not affect the expression of BK channels. Together, our results indicate that as shown in other cell types, activation of BK channels by themselves also promote rMSC migration, and show that activation of BK channels contribute to the observed PL-induced increase in migration of rMSC.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The large increase in numbers of refugees and asylum seekers in Germany and most of Europe has put the issue of migration itself, the integration of migrants, and also their health at the top of the political agenda. However, the dynamics of refugee health are not yet well understood. From a life-course perspective, migration experience is associated with various risks and changes, which might differ depending on the socioeconomic status (SES) of refugees in their home country. The aim of this paper was to analyze the relationship between pre-migration SES and self-reported health indicators after migration among Syrian refugees. Specifically, we wanted to find out how their SES affects the change in health satisfaction from pre- to post-migration. METHODS AND FINDINGS:We used data from the 2016 refugee survey, which was part of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). Although cross-sectional by design, this survey collected information referring to the current situation as a refugee in Germany as well as to their situation before migration. Using a sample of 2,209 adult Syrian refugees who had entered Germany between 2013 and 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional and a quasi-longitudinal (retrospective) analysis. The mean ± SD age was 35 ± 11 years, with 64% of the participants being male. Our results showed a positive association between pre-migration self-reported SES and several subjective health indicators (e.g., health satisfaction, self-reported health, mental health) in the cross-sectional analysis. However, the quasi-longitudinal analysis revealed that the socioeconomic gradient in health satisfaction before migration was strongly attenuated after migration (SES-by-time interaction: -0.48, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.35, p &lt; 0.001; unstandardized regression coefficients, 5-point SES scale and 11-point health outcome scale). Similar results were produced after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, experiences during the migration passage, and the current situation in Germany. A sex-stratified analysis showed that while there was some improvement in health satisfaction among men from the lowest SES over time, no improvement was found among women. A limitation of this study is that it considers only the first months or years after migration. Thus, we cannot preclude that the socioeconomic gradient regains importance in the longer run. CONCLUSIONS:Our findings suggest that the pre-migration socioeconomic gradient in health satisfaction is strongly attenuated in the first years after migration among Syrian refugees. Hence, a high SES before crisis and migration provides limited protection against the adverse health effects of migration passage.">

Various databases available at both national and international levels were taken to address the five dimensions. The findings showed that push and pull factors and infrastructure differentials are taken into consideration while Saudi population internally migrate. All the GCC countries, including Saudi Arabia, experience international migration streams subject to the labour requirements and governmental regulations for both Arabs and non-Arabs.

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of a single cell migrating on an elastic matrix, which accounts for the deformation of the matrix induced by forces exerted by the cell, and investigate how the stiffness impacts the direction and speed of migration. We model a cell in 1D as a nucleus connected to a number of adhesion sites through elastic springs. The cell migrates by randomly updating the position of its adhesion sites. We start by investigating the case where the cell springs are constant, and then go on to assuming that they depend on the matrix stiffness, on matrices of both uniform stiffness as well as those with a stiffness gradient. We find that the assumption that cell springs depend on the substrate stiffness is necessary and sufficient for an efficient durotactic response. We compare simulations to recent experimental observations of human cancer cells exhibiting durotaxis, which show good qualitative agreement.">

We used satellite telemetry and experimental translocation to quantify differences and assess heritability in migration behaviours between three migratory Asian houbara (Chlamydotis macqueenii) breeding populations (640 km range across eastern, central and western Uzbekistan). Adults from the eastern population migrated twice as far (mean = 1184 km ± 44 s.e.) as the western population (656 km ± 183 s.e.) and showed significantly less variation in migration distance than the central population (1030 km ± 127 s.e.). The western and central populations wintered significantly further north (mean: +8.32° N ± 1.70 s.e. and +4.19° N ± 1.16 s.e., respectively) and the central population further west (-3.47° E ± 1.46 s.e.) than individuals from the eastern population. These differences could arise from a differing innate drive, or through learnt facultative responses to topography, filtered by survival. Translocated birds from the eastern population (wild-laid and captive-reared, n = 5) migrated further than adults from either western or central recipient populations, particularly in their second migration year. Translocated birds continued migrating south past suitable wintering grounds used by the recipient populations despite having to negotiate mountain obstacles. Together, this suggests a considerable conserved heritable migratory component with local adaptation at a fine geographic scale. Surviving translocated individuals returned to their release site, suggesting that continued translocations would lead to introgression of the heritable component and risk altering recipient migration patterns. Conservation biologists considering translocation interventions for migratory populations should evaluate potential genetic components of migratory behaviour.">

Correlations between metformin concentration and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and miR-142-3p levels were assessed. In addition, miR-142-3p mimic and siRNA were used to investigate VSMC migration in the presence or absence of metformin. In the high-glucose condition, metformin decreased cell growth and inhibited cell migration. HMGB1 gene expression correlated negatively with metformin concentration, whereas miR-142-3p expression correlated positively with metformin concentration. In addition, mimic-induced miR-142-3p elevation resulted in decreased HMGB1 and LC3II levels and elevated p62 levels in the high-glucose condition, whereas miR-142-3p knockdown had the reverse effects, and metformin abolished those effects. Metformin inhibits high glucose-induced VSMC hyperproliferation and increased migration by inducing miR-142-3p-mediated inhibition of HMGB1 expression via the HMGB1-autophagy related pathway.">

We combine the static and dynamic SPHARM approach with a support-vector-machine classifier and compare their classification accuracies. We demonstrate that the dynamic SPHARM analysis classifies cell migration patterns more accurately than the static one for both synthetic and experimental data. Furthermore, by comparing the computed accuracies with that of a naive classifier, we can identify the experimental conditions and model parameters that significantly affect cell shape. This capability should - in the future - help to pinpoint factors that play an essential role in cell migration.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Understanding the genetic structure of natural populations provides insight into the demographic and adaptive processes that have affected those populations. Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam. METHODS:The optimal density of EEMS grids was determined based on a new workflow created using density clustering to define genomic clusters and the spatial distance between genomic clusters. Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns. RESULTS:Optimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced computing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, EEMS migration maps generated for P. falciparum using the optimized grid corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration, supporting the validity of the observed migration patterns. CONCLUSIONS:Optimized grids reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can result from user-defined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model. This workflow will be useful to a broad range of EEMS users as it can be applied to analyses involving other organisms of interest and geographic areas.">

Here, we report on the quasi-periodic movement of cells confined in stripe-shaped microlanes. We observe persistent polarized cell shapes and directed pole-to-pole motion within the microlanes. Cells depolarize at one end of a given microlane, followed by delayed repolarization towards the opposite end. We analyze cell motility via the spatial velocity distribution, the velocity frequency spectrum and the reversal time as a measure for depolarization and spontaneous repolarization of cells at the microlane ends. The frequent encounters of a boundary in the stripe geometry provides a robust framework for quantitative investigations of the cytoskeleton protrusion and repolarization dynamics. In a first advance to rigorously test physical models of cell migration, we find that the statistics of the cell migration is recapitulated by a Cellular Potts model with a minimal description of cytoskeleton dynamics. Using LifeAct-GFP transfected cells and microlanes with differently shaped ends, we show that the local deformation of the leading cell edge in response to the tip geometry can locally either amplify or quench actin polymerization, while leaving the average reversal times unaffected.">

We postulate that the peculiar anti-gravity movement of the FNE in the medial migration phenomenon stems from a ratcheting mechanism at the intramedullary nail-FNE interface, which should inadvertently produce unique wear patterns on the FNE that can be seen with high-powered microscopy. By examining the wear patterns on retrieved implants from patients with medial migration, our study aims to draw clinical correlations to the ratcheting mechanism hypothesis. Material and Methods:Four FNEs were retrieved from revision surgeries of four patients with prior intramedullary nail fixation of their pertrochanteric hip fractures complicated by femoral head perforation. The FNEs were divided into two groups based on whether or not there was radiographic evidence of medial migration prior to the revisions. Wear patterns on the FNEs were then assessed using both scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. Results:Repetitive, linearly-arranged, regularly-spaced, unique transverse scratch marks were found only in the group with medial migration, corresponding to the specific segment of the FNE that passed through the intramedullary component of the PFNA during medial migration. These scratch marks were absent in the group without medial migration. Conclusion:Our findings are in support of a ratcheting mechanism behind the medial migration phenomenon with repetitive toggling at the intramedullary nail-FNE interface and progressive propagation of the FNE against gravity.">

A critical proposition in exploiting bifunctionality in alloy catalysts is to achieve surface migration across interfaces separating functionally dissimilar regions. Herein, we demonstrate the enhancement of more than 104 in the rate of molecular hydrogen reduction of a silver surface oxide in the presence of palladium oxide compared to pure silver oxide resulting from the transfer of atomic hydrogen from palladium oxide islands onto the surrounding surface formed from oxidation of a palladium-silver alloy. The palladium-silver interface also dynamically restructures during reduction, resulting in silver-palladium intermixing. This study clearly demonstrates the migration of reaction intermediates and catalyst material across surface interfacial boundaries in alloys with a significant effect on surface reactivity, having broad implications for the catalytic function of bimetallic materials.">

The expression of miR-92 and neogenin was evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured by MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The migration and invasion abilities were examined by transwell assays. The interaction between miR-92 and neogenin was conducted by dual-luciferase reporter system. As a result, we found that the expression of miR-92 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Down-regulation of miR-92 inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted cell apoptosis rate of U251 and U87 cells. Notably, miR-92 was identified to directly target to 3'-UTR of neogenin. Furthermore, neogenin was down-regulated in glioma tissues and cells in a miR-92-correlated manner. Overexpression of neigenin could cause similar results to miR-92 knockdown in U251 and U87 cells. However, the silencing of neogenin partially reversed the effects of miR-92 knockdown on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of glioma cells in vitro. In conclusion, we clarified that miR-92 knockdown could suppress the malignant progression of glioma cells in vitro by targeting neogenin. Therefore, miR-92 could serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker in glioma patients.">

The objectives of this study were to identify the relation between AHI, IGHD, and UMI when measured with radiography and MRI and to determine whether superior migration can predict the irreparability of massive rotator cuff tears. METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed the files of 64 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic partial or complete repair for massive rotator cuff tears at our institution between August 2015 and August 2018. We recorded both radiography and MRI measurements of AHI, IGHD, and UMI, and further the tangent sign, fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles, and the Patte grade. We performed correlation assessments and multiple logistic regression analysis to identify potential predictors of the reparability of massive rotator cuff tears. RESULTS:Thirty-five patients had partially reparable and 29 had completely reparable tears. Parameters measured with either radiography or MRI were highly correlated with each other. The radiographic measurements showed a moderate or low correlation with the MRI measurements. All parameters of superior migration of the humeral head on radiography and MRI, the tangent sign, fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus muscle, and the Patte grade showed significant differences between patients with partially and completely repaired tears. Among these, the independent predictors for irreparability was Patte grade = 3. CONCLUSION:The AHI, IGHD, and UMI were highly correlated when measured with either radiography or MRI, but not when comparing their radiographic with their MRI values. Furthermore, they were not independent indicators of reparability in massive rotator cuff tears.">

It is assumed that the successful outcome of AT transfer essentially depends on the amount of autocrine-generated growth factors (GF). It is supposed that several GF enhance and improve the anatomic and functional integration of the transplanted AT grafts at the site of implantation. In the present study we have investigated for the first time the correlation between the concentration of GF of freshly isolated AT and the proliferation and migration capacity of mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) derived from the respective AT sample. We here show that the proliferation and migration capacity of MSCs strongly depends on the GF content of the AT the cells were isolated from but in an inversely proportional manner. The lower the GF content of an AT sample was, the higher was the proliferation and migration capacity of the respective MSC population contained in the AT and vice versa. Furthermore, we found that supplementation with recombinant GFs only in the case of AT samples with low but not with higher growth factor contents led to a significant enhancement of proliferation and migration of the AT-resident MSCs. As we further show, this inefficiency of GFs to enhance MSC proliferation and migration in AT samples with high GF contents indicates a GF-mediated negative feedback mechanism leading to an impaired GF signaling in MSC obtained from those AT samples. Our results might explain why the successful use of AT grafting is frequently limited by low and unpredictable survival rates, and we suggest to use the knowledge of GF content of harvested AT as a predictive clinical parameter for risk assessment of the therapeutic outcome of autologous AT transfer.">

Our previous research found that CD9, a trans-membrane protein, is involved in wound re-epithelialization and CD9 downregulation contributes to keratinocytes migration. In this study, we observed the effect of EF on CD9 expression and keratinocytes migration. The keratinocytes migrated directionally toward the cathode and CD9 expression was down-regulated under EF (200mV/mm). In addition, CD9 overexpression reversed EF-induced migratory speed and the electrotactic response of keratinocytes. Also, we found that EF reduced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Furthermore, AICAR, an AMPK activator, increased CD9 expression under EF, while compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, decreased CD9 expression in keratinocytes. Our results demonstrate that EF regulates CD9 expression and keratinocytes directional migration, in which AMPK pathway plays an important role.">

This study aimed to elucidate the role of Rap2c in glioma and its specific molecular mechanism. Methods:We determined the expression of Rap2c in glioma tissues by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The proliferation and apoptosis of cells were explored using CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay, whereas the migration and invasion of glioma cells were determined using transwell assay. The potential mechanism of Rap2c in the migration of glioma cell lines was investigated through Western blotting analysis and transwell assay. BALB/c nude mice were used to establish tumor models to test the effect of Rap2c on cancer metastasis in vivo. Results:Our data showed that the protein expression of Rap2c was significantly up-regulated in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues, and Rap2c overexpression negatively correlated with 5-year overall survival rate. However, there was no correlation between Rap2c expression and clinicopathological parameters of glioma patients. Overexpression of Rap2c promoted the migration and invasion abilities of glioma cells but had no significant effect on the proliferation of glioma cells. Western blotting analysis revealed that Rap2c overexpression increased the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-related kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), and this effect was abolished with U0126, a selective MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, overexpression of Rap2c induced lung metastasis of glioma cells in xenograft models. Conclusion:These findings indicate that high Rap2c expression predicts poor prognosis in glioma. Rap2c-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation initiates EMT cascade and promotes migration and invasion of glioma cells. Thus, targeting Rap2c and ERK signaling pathway could be a novel treatment modality for glioma.">

        <span class="abst" title="A central and unique aspect of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is the extensive transcoelomic spreading of tumor cell via the peritoneal fluid or malignant ascites. We and others identified tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the ascites as promoters of metastasis-associated processes like extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, tumor cell migration, adhesion, and invasion. The precise mechanisms and mediators involved in these functions of TAM are, however, largely unknown. We observed that HGSC migration is promoted by soluble mediators from ascites-derived TAM, which can be emulated by conditioned medium from monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) differentiated in ascites to TAM-like asc-MDM. A similar effect was observed with IL-10-induced alternatively activated m2c-MDM but not with LPS/IFNγ-induced inflammatory m1-MDM. These observations provided the basis for deconvolution of the complex TAM secretome by performing comparative secretome analysis of matched triplets of different MDM phenotypes with different pro-migratory properties (asc-MDM, m2c-MDM, m1-MDM). Mass spectrometric analysis identified an overlapping set of nine proteins secreted by both asc-MDM and m2c-MDM, but not by m1-MDM. Of these, three proteins, i.e., transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI) protein, tenascin C (TNC), and fibronectin (FN1), have been associated with migration-related functions. Intriguingly, increased ascites concentrations of TGFBI, TNC, and fibronectin were associated with short progression-free survival. Furthermore, transcriptome and secretome analyses point to TAM as major producers of these proteins, further supporting an essential role for TAM in promoting HGSC progression. Consistent with this hypothesis, we were able to demonstrate that the migration-inducing potential of asc-MDM and m2c-MDM secretomes is inhibited, at least partially, by neutralizing antibodies against TGFBI and TNC or siRNA-mediated silencing of TGFBI expression. In conclusion, the present study provides the first experimental evidence that TAM-derived TGFBI and TNC in ascites promote HGSC progression.">

Methods:The expression of lncRNA-NEAT1 and miR-124 was detected in CC tissues and cells (HeLa and SiHa cells) by qRT-RCR. The relation between lncRNA-NEAT1 expression and clinical parameters of CC patients was explored. The cell migration and invasion were detected by wound healing assay and transwell assay. The cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 and anchorage-independent colony assay. The targeting relation between miR-124 and lncRNA-NEAT1 was predicted by TargetScan and identified by dual luciferase reporter gene and RNA pull-down assay. The expression of metastasis- (MMP-2 and MMP), EMT- (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin), and NF-κB pathway-related factors (NF-κB p65, p-NF-κB p65 and IκBα) was detected by Western blot. Results:The expression of lncRNA-NEAT1 was upregulated in CC tissues and cells and positively correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of lncRNA-NEAT1 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion, influenced the expression of EMT markers, and activated NF-κB pathway in HeLa and SiHa cells. Silencing of lncRNA-NEAT1 exhibited opposite effects on HeLa and SiHa cells. LncRNA-NEAT1 could negatively regulate its target miR-124. MiR-124 reversed the effects of lncRNA-NEAT1 on the migration, invasion, EMT and NF-κB pathway of HeLa cells. Conclusion:LncRNA-NEAT1 promoted the migration and invasion of CC cells via regulating miR-124/NF-κB pathway.">

The effect of ISO-1 on PANC-1 cell proliferation was examined using CCK-8 cell proliferation assay. The effect of ISO-1 on collective cell migration and recolonization of PANC-1 cells was evaluated using the cell-wound closure migration assay. The effect of ISO-1 on the migration and invasion of individual PANC-1 cells in a 3-dimensional environment in response to a chemo-attractant was investigated through the use of Transwell migration/invasion assays. Quantitative real time PCR and western blot analyses were employed to investigate the effects of ISO-1 on MIF, NF-κB p65 and TNF-α mRNA and protein expression respectively. Finally, a xenograft tumor model in BALB/c nude mice were used to assess the in vivo effects of ISO-1 on PANC-1-induced tumor growth. We found high expression of MIF in pancreatic cancer tissues. We demonstrated that ISO-1 exerts anti-cancer effects on PANC-1 cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and inhibited PANC-1 cell-induced tumour growth in xenograft mice in vivo.

The protein expression of FOXD1 was detected by western blot. The cell viability and colony formation abilities were examined by CCK-8 and colony formation assays, respectively.

Result:miR-30a-5p was downregulated in LSCC tissues and cells, while FOXD1 was highly expressed. Overexpression of miR-30a-5p or silencing FOXD1 inhibited cell viability, colony formation ability, migration, and invasion of LSCC cells. miR-30a-5p inhibited the proliferation and migration of LSCC cells by downregulating the expression of FOXD1.

We hypothesized that tumor cells might actively migrate toward intratumor vessels with the extracellular metabolic gradient acting as a guiding cue. Here, we determined in vitro whether the extracellular gradient of pH can act as a cue for directional migration in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cell migration was determined by the wound-healing assay under gradients of extracellular pH (~0.2 units/mm) and oxygen concentration (~6% O2/mm) that were produced by a microfluidic device, gap cover glass (GCG). Without GCG, the migration of cells was spatially homogeneous; the same number of cells migrated to the rectangular wound space from the left and right boundaries. In contrast, when GCG generated pH/O2 gradients across the wound space, the number of cells migrating to the wound space from the boundary with higher pH/O2 values was considerably decreased, indicating a preferential movement of cells toward the region of higher pH/O2 in the gradient. The addition of hepes in the extracellular medium abolished both the extracellular pH gradient and the directional cell migration under GCG. We conclude that relatively small gradients of pH in the extracellular medium compared to those found in Na+/H+ exchanger-driven cell migration were sufficient to guide MDA-MB-231 cells. The directional cell migration as guided by the metabolic gradient could effectively elevate the probability of intravasation and, ultimately, hematogenous metastasis.">

The supervision and analysis of population migration are necessary for guiding the optimal allocation of urban resources and for attaining the high efficiency development of region. Currently, the explorations of population migration are often restricted by the limitation of data. In the information era, search engines widely collect public attention, implying potential individual actions, and freely provide open, timelier, and large-scope search query data for helping explore regional phenomena and problems. In this paper, we endeavor to explore the possibility of adopting such data to depict population migration. Based on the search query from Baidu search engine, three migration attention indexes (MAIs) are constructed to capture public migration attention in cyber space. Taking three major urban agglomerations in China as case study, we conduct the correlation analysis among the cyber MAIs and population migration in geographical space. Results have shown that external-MAI and local-MAI can positively reflect the population migration inner regions and across regions from a holistic lens and that intercity-MAI can be a helpful supplement for the delineation of specific population flow. Along with the accumulation of cyber search query data, its potential in exploring population migration can be further reinforced.">

The aims of this study were: (i) to assess the possibility of measuring potential head-taper movement in THA in vivo using model-based RSA and (ii) to prove the validity of measured head-taper migration data in vitro and in vivo. From a previous RSA study with a 10 years follow-up, retrospectively for n = 45 patients head-taper migration was calculated as the relative migration between femoral ball head and taper of the femoral stem using model-based RSA. A head-taper migration of 0.026 mm/year can be detected with available RSA technology. In vitro validation showed a total migration of 268 ± 11 µm along the taper axis in a similar range to what has been reported using the RSA method. In vivo, a proof for interchangeable applicability of model-based RSA (EGS) and standard marker-based RSA methods was indicated by a significant deviation within the migration result after 12-month follow-up for all translation measurements, which was significantly correlated to the measured head-taper migration (r from 0.40 to 0.67; p &lt; 0.05). The results identified that model-based RSA (EGS) could be used to detect head-taper migration in vivo and the measured movement could be validated in vitro and in vivo as well. Those findings supported the possibility of applying RSA for helping evaluate the head-taper corrosion related failure (trunnionosis).">

        <span class="abst" title="Migration to the U.S. has been associated with increased body size and obesity risk in Latinas, but results for Caribbean immigrant women are limited and inconclusive. Emerging evidence also suggests that early-life environment associations with women's midlife body mass index (BMI) may be different for larger and smaller women, but this has not been tested within migration life-course history. We examined the associations of nativity and migration timing with midlife body size in a sample of majority Caribbean Latinas and whether these associations varied across the body size distribution. We used interview data from 787 self-identified Latinas (ages 40-65 years) and assessed overall obesity using BMI (kg/m2) and central obesity based on waist circumference (WC, cm). We used linear and quantile regression to examine the association of migration history with BMI and WC and logistic regression for the probability of obesity. Foreign birthplace, later migration age, and lower percent of life in the U.S. were associated with lower BMI and WC means and lower odds of overall and central obesity. Quantile regression showed only inverse associations in the upper quantiles of BMI and WC. For example, relative to U.S.-born women, women living &lt;50% of their lives in the U.S. had lower BMI in the 75th BMI percentile (β = -4.10, 95% CI: -6.75, -0.81), with minimal differences in the 25th (β = 0.04, 95% CI: -1.01, 0.96) and 50th BMI percentiles (β = -1.54, 95% CI: -2.90, 0.30). Our results support that migration to and increasing time in the U.S. are associated with greater body size in midlife Latina women, with stronger influences at higher body size distribution.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are being found to play crucial roles in ATC progression. Herein, we focused on the role of nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) on ATC progression under hypoxia and underlying mechanisms governing it. Methods:The expression levels of NEAT1, miR-206 and miR-599 were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell migration and invasion abilities were detected using transwell assays. Glucose consumption and lactate production were determined using a corresponding commercial assay kit. Western blot was performed to evaluate the level of hexokinase 2 (HK2). The targeted interplays between NEAT1 and miR-206 or miR-599 were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Xenograft model was established to observe the effect of NEAT1 on tumor growth in vivo. Results:Our data indicated that NEAT1 was highly expressed in ATC tissues and cells, and hypoxia induced NEAT1 expression in ATC cells. NEAT1 depletion repressed ATC cell migration, invasion and glycolysis under hypoxia. Mechanistically, NEAT1 acted as a molecular sponge of miR-206 and miR-599. Moreover, the repressive effects of NEAT1 knockdown on ATC cell migration, invasion and glycolysis under hypoxia were mediated by miR-206 or miR-599. Additionally, NEAT1 knockdown weakened tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion:In conclusion, our study suggested that a low NEAT1 expression suppressed the migration, invasion, and glycolysis in ATC cells under hypoxia at least partially through modulating miR-206 and miR-599, providing new therapeutic strategies for ATC treatment.">

Cell viability, migration ability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT, transwell and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot analysis was performed to assess associated protein expression.Results: PRP, SOWPa (100 mg/kg) or PRP + SOWPa (100 mg/kg) treatment for 72 h significantly improved the cell viability of ACL fibroblasts from 100 ± 7.5% (control) to 156.85 ± 12.82%, 188.08 ± 15.92%, and 223.67 ± 18.82%, respectively, which was evidenced by individual decreased apoptosis rate from 31.26 ± 2.35% (control) to 20.80 ± 1.89%, 18.01 ± 1.55% and 9.33 ± 0.78%. Furthermore, the motility of ACL fibroblasts was significantly improved with increased migrated cell number per field from 5 for control to 26 for PRP, 36 for SOWPa and 44 for PRP + SOWPa, respectively. Moreover, the protein expression of differentiation markers (RUNX2, ALP, BMP2 and Col I) and TLR-4 and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) was inhibited by the above treatment.Discussion and conclusions: Data suggested that the addition of SOWPa to PRP increased the regenerative ability of ACL fibroblasts by blocking the TLR-4/NF-κB pathway.">

However, little is known about lipid alternations in CAFs and how these metabolic reprogramming affect CRC cells metastasis. Here, we uncover CAFs conditioned medium (CM) promote the migration of CRC cells compared with normal fibroblasts CM. CAFs undergo a lipidomic reprogramming, and accumulate more fatty acids and phospholipids. CAFs CM after protein deprivation still increase the CRC cells migration, which suggests small molecular metabolites in CAFs CM are responsible for CRC cells migration. Then, we confirm that CRC cells take up the lipids metabolites that are secreted from CAFs. Fatty acids synthase (FASN), a crucial enzyme in fatty acids synthesis, is significantly increased in CAFs. CAF-induced CRC cell migration is abolished by knockdown of FASN by siRNA or reducing the uptake of fatty acids by CRC cells by sulfo-N-succinimidyloleate sodium in vitro and CD36 monoclonal antibody in vivo. To conclude, our results provide a new insight into the mechanism of CRC metastasis and suggest FASN of CAFs or CD36 of CRC cells may be potential targets for anti-metastasis treatment in the future.">

Chrysin, a natural flavone frequently present in honey, has been recognized to exhibit anti-tumor properties. In this study, we investigated the effects of Chrysin in the expression pattern of TET proteins in gastric cancer (GC) cells. Materials and Methods:Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we analyzed the expression of TET1 in GC cells in vitro following treatment with Chrysin. Immunofluorescence staining detected the expression levels of 5mC and 5hmC. Flow cytometry, wound healing, and Matrigel invasion assays were performed to determine cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration and invasion of GC cells following treatment with Chrysin, si-TET1, and TET1-KO. Furthermore, a xenograft model was developed to analyze the expression pattern of TET1 on tumor development in vivo. Results:qRT-PCR and Western blot assays indicated that treatment with Chrysin significantly promoted the expression of TET1 in GC cells. Immunofluorescence study further confirmed that TET1 and 5hmC levels were significantly enhanced following treatment with Chrysin in MKN45 cells. Moreover, our results suggested that Chrysin could noticeably induce cell apoptosis and inhibit cell migration and invasion. Further, knockdown and overexpression of TET1 were conducted to investigate whether TET1 expression affected cell apoptosis, and cell migration and invasion in MKN45 cells. The results indicated that overexpression of TET1 markedly promoted cell apoptosis and inhibited cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the TET1 gene knocked out was generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Our data suggested that TET1 expression was associated with GC tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion:This study indicated that Chrysin exerted anti-tumor effects through the regulation of TET1 expression in GC and presented TET1 as a novel promising therapeutic target for GC therapy.">

Transwell migration assays and wound healing assays were performed to compare the effect of PENK on migration. Moreover, LY294002 was used to identify the potential mechanism. Gene expression was examined via qRT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS:Bioinformatic analysis revealed that PENK was downregulated in OS tumor samples compared with normal human osteoblasts. Moreover, PENK was identified as the hub gene of the DEGs. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was significantly enriched in the DEGs. Moreover, PENK was downregulated in OS and MG63 cells compared with the corresponding control cells. Silencing PENK promoted MG63 cell migration; however, treatment with LY294002 partially attenuated PENK silencing-induced OS cell migration.

Materials and Methods:Using bioinformatic analyses, we investigated the expression of LINC01272 in TCGA database and predicted the biological functions and mechanism of LINC01272 in GC. Then, we detected the expression of LINC01272 in GC cell lines, GC tissues, and corresponding normal tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Finally, we explored the migration and invasion ability of LINC01272 by wound-healing and Transwell assays and examined the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins through Western blotting. Results:We found that LINC01272 was upregulated in GC and was associated with GC staging and lymph node metastasis. The results of wound-healing and Transwell assays revealed that the LINC01272 was closely related to GC cell migration and invasion. LINC01272 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion ability of GC cells by reducing the expression of EMT-related proteins. Overexpression of LINC01272 had the opposite effect. Conclusion:Together, our results showed that LINC01272 promoted GC metastasis ability by regulating the expression of EMT-related proteins and could serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for GC.">

Methods:Bioinformatics methods were applied to screen differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs for construction of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. LINC00461, KPNA2 and miR-144-3p were identified, and KPNA2 was predicted to be a target of miR-144-3p and significantly correlated with breast cancer prognosis. To make the findings more convincible, we used qRT-PCR to detect the expression levels of LINC00461 and miR-144-3p in breast cancer cells, and conducted western blot to determine KPNA2 protein level. Then, RIP was performed to assess the combination between miR-144-3p and LINC00461 or KPNA2, and dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the targeted relationship between miR-144-3p and KPNA2. Furthermore, Transwell was employed for the examination of cell invasion and migration in breast cancer. Results:LINC00461 was predicted to regulate KPNA2 through sponging miR-144-3p as revealed by the ceRNA network. Besides, LINC00461 and KPNA2 were found to be remarkably highly-expressed in breast cancer cells, while miR-144-3p was poorly-expressed. Silencing LINC00461 could promote miR-144-3p expression, thus inhibiting cell invasion and migration. In addition, KPNA2 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-144-3p. Silencing miR-144-3p or overexpressing KPNA2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of LINC00461 silencing on cell invasion and migration in breast cancer. Conclusion:LINC00461 promoted the expression of KPNA2 by competitively binding to miR-144-3p, thereby promoting the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells.">

        <span class="abst" title="Rural amenity migration, or the relocation for quality of life purposes as opposed to monetary enhancement, has been occurring for decades and has been particularly pronounced in the American West where the phenomenon peaked in the 1990s. Researchers have illustrated that some places are more attractive for migrants than others and that certain regional amenities hold considerable influence on where migrants relocate. Increased migration levels typically result in increased economic growth indicators, making amenity migration an attractive rural development strategy. But comprehensive econometric analysis focused on amenity migration in the American West has been lacking. To address this, we conducted an econometric analysis of attributes that influenced migration to rural Western counties from 1980 to 2010. Over 20 potential amenity supply categories were collated for 356 rural counties from 11 Western states, with a focus on public lands. Descriptive statistics and OLS regressions were estimated and interpreted. Traditional amenities of climate, water area, and regional access were highly associated with migration levels, while designated natural amenities of Wilderness and National Monuments were the most influential public lands for migration to rural Western counties. Farming and oil and gas dependency were negatively associated with migration levels. Increasing the amount of protected areas, and branding campaigns based on natural amenities, can be a critical development strategy for rural communities.">

Bone marrow‑derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a potential therapeutic source of cells following central nervous system damage; however, few studies have investigated the effects of BMSCs on cell migration. Thus, in the present study, the effects of BMSCs on NPC migration were investigated. In the present study, BMSCs and NPCs were isolated and cultured from mice. The effects of BMSCs on the migration of NPCs were analyzed using a Transwell cell migration assay. BMSCs were transfected with microRNA‑210 (miR‑210) mimics and inhibitors to examine the effects of the respective upregulation and downregulation of miR‑210 in BMSCs on the migration of NPCs. Then, miR‑210 expression in BMSCs were quantified and the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor‑C (VEGF‑C), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and chemokine C‑C motif ligand 3 (CCL3) in the supernatant under hypoxic conditions were investigated via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and ELISA. Subsequently, the expression of VEGF‑C, BDNF and CCL3 in BMSCs overexpressing miR‑210 or BMSCs suppressing miR‑210 was examined by RT‑qPCR and western blot analyses. BMSCs promoted the migration of NPC, particularly when pre‑cultured with BMSCs for 24 h and co‑cultured with NPCs for 24 h; the miR‑210 expression levels increased under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, the migration of NPCs was also increased when the BMSCs overexpressed miR‑210 compared with the BMSCs transfected with a negative control miR and BMSCs with downregulated miR‑210 levels. The expression levels of VEGF‑C increased in the BMSCs that overexpressed miR‑210 and were decreased in BMSCs transfected with a miR‑210 inhibitor. The results of the present study indicated that BMSCs promote the migration of NPCs. Overexpression of miR‑210 in BMSCs enhanced NPC migration and may be associated with increases in VEGF‑C expression levels.">

The present study aimed to explore the features of cellosaurus REB cells with mutant and wide-type IDH1. Methods: To compare the features of IDH1 knockout and mutation in cholangiocarcinoma, we firstly constructed the IDH1 knockout and IDH1 mutation cell lines. We then evaluated the viability of these cell lines using the cell count assay and MTT assay. Next, we determined cell migration and invasion using the Transwell assay. Additionally, to evaluate the effects of IDH1 on cellular metabolism, the levels of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We then applied ChIPbase dataset to explore the genes that were regulated by IDH1. Results: High frequency of mutated IDH1 was observed in the cholangiocarcinoma and IDH1 R132C was presented in more than 80% of mutations. The results showed that IDH1 knockout decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas the overexpression of IDH1 in IDH1 knockout cell line recovered its proliferation, migration and invasion capacities. Additionally, IDH1 mutation reduced the levels of NADPH and α-KG. Furthermore, investigation into the underlying mechanisms revealed that IDH1 overexpression induced the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 thereby promoting cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Conclusion: IDH1 plays an important role in cholangiocarcinoma and its mutation impairs tumor progression in part by inhibition of isocitrate metabolism.">

Data on ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

We calculated differences in PM2.5 exposure between &quot;current&quot; (2016-2017) and &quot;origin&quot; (2012) districts for each migration patterns. Using an exposure-response relationship for PM2.5 extracted from a meta-analysis, and mortality rates from the Peruvian Ministry of Health, we quantified premature mortality attributable to each migration pattern. Changes in outdoor PM2.5 exposure were observed between 2012 and 2016 with highest levels of PM2.5 in the Department of Lima. A strong spatial autocorrelation of outdoor PM2.5 values (Moran's I = 0.847, p-value=0.001) was observed. In Greater Lima, rural-to-urban and urban-to-urban migrants experienced 10-fold increases in outdoor PM2.5 exposure in comparison with non-migrants. Changes in outdoor PM2.5 exposure due to migration drove 137.1 (95%CI: 93.2, 179.4) premature deaths related to air pollution, with rural-urban producing the highest risk of mortality from exposure to higher levels of ambient air pollution. Our results demonstrate that the rural-urban and urban-urban migrant groups have higher rates of air pollution-related deaths.">

In the Arctic, snow directly influences resource availability. The causes and consequences of different migration patterns of migratory species as a response to the snow conditions remains however unexplored. Birds migrating to the Arctic are expected to follow the spring snowmelt to optimise their arrival time and select for snow-free areas to maximise prey encounter en-route. Based on large-scale movement data, we compared the migration patterns of three top predator species of the tundra in relation to the spatio-temporal dynamics of snow cover. The snowy owl, an irruptive migrant, the rough-legged buzzard, with an intermediary migration pattern, and the peregrine falcon as a regular migrant, all followed, as expected, the spring snowmelt during their migrations. However, the owl stayed ahead, the buzzard stayed on, and the falcon stayed behind the spatio-temporal peak in snowmelt. Although none of the species avoided snow-covered areas, they presumably used snow presence as a cue to time their arrival at their breeding grounds. We show the importance of environmental cues for species with different migration patterns.">

FEZF1-AS1, miR-34a, and NOTCH-1 were overexpressed to analyze the relationship between them. Transwell assays were performed to analyze the effects of transfections on cell invasion and migration. RESULTS:FEZF1-AS1 was up-regulated in NSCLC patients. Increased expression levels of FEZF1-AS1 were observed with the increase in clinical stages. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-34a can bind with FEZF1-AS1. In NSCLC tissues, NOTCH-1 and FEZF1-AS1 were positively correlated. In NSCLC cells, over-expression of FEZF1-AS1 resulted in up-regulated expressions of NOTCH-1, while miR-34a over-expression mediated down-regulated expressions of NOTCH-1. In addition, FEZF1-AS1 and miR-34a did not alter each other, while bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-34a can bind FEZF1-AS1. Analysis of cell migration and invasion showed increased cell invasion and migration rates after FEZF1-AS1 and NOTCH-1 over-expression.

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Fibroblasts are crucial for supporting normal wound healing. However, the functional state of these cells is impaired in diabetics because of a high-glucose (HG) microenvironment. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have emerged as a promising tool for skin wound treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sEVs derived from human decidua-derived mesenchymal stem cells (dMSC-sEVs) on HG-induced human dermal fibroblast (HDF) senescence and diabetic wound healing and explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS:We first created a HDF senescent model induced by HG in vitro. dMSC-conditioned medium (dMSC-CM) and dMSC-sEVs were collected and applied to treat the HG-induced HDFs. We then examined the proliferation, migration, differentiation, and senescence of these fibroblasts. At the same time, the expressions of RAGE, p21 RAS, Smad2/3, and pSmad2/3 were also analyzed. Furthermore, pSmad2/3 inhibitor (SB431542) was used to block the expression of pSmad2/3 to determine whether dMSC-sEVs improved HDF senescence by activating Smad pathway. Finally, we assessed the effect of dMSC-sEVs on diabetic wound healing. RESULTS:The HG microenvironment impaired the proliferation, migration, and differentiation abilities of the HDFs and accelerated their senescence. dMSC-CM containing sEVs improved the proliferation and migration abilities of the HG-induced fibroblasts. dMSC-sEVs internalized by HG-induced HDFs not only significantly promoted HDF proliferation, migration, and differentiation, but also improved the senescent state. Furthermore, dMSC-sEVs inhibited the expression of RAGE and stimulated the activation of Smad signaling pathway in these cells. However, SB431542 (pSmad2/3 inhibitor) could partially alleviate the anti-senescent effects of dMSC-sEVs on HG-induced HDFs. Moreover, the local application of dMSC-sEVs accelerated collagen deposition and led to enhanced wound healing in diabetic mice. The detection of PCNA, CXCR4, α-SMA, and p21 showed that dMSC-sEVs could enhance HDF proliferation, migration, and differentiation abilities and improve HDF senescent state in vivo. CONCLUSION:dMSC-sEVs have regenerative and protective effects on HG-induced senescent fibroblasts by suppressing RAGE pathway and activating Smad pathway, thereby accelerating diabetic wound healing. This indicates that dMSC-sEVs may be a promising candidate for diabetic wound treatment.">

Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) is an inner-mitochondrial membrane protein that participates in parkin-induced mitophagy. However, the role of PHB2 in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has not been previously reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS PHB2 protein or PHB2-mRNA in NSCLC and paired normal tissues was determined by Western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemical staining. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell migration assays. A 3D live-cell confocal system was used to monitor autophagic flux. Mitochondrial autolysosomes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, we performed JC-1 assay to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). RESULTS The level of PHB2 was significantly increased in human NSCLC specimens compared to paired adjacent specimens. Inhibition of PHB2 expression attenuated mitophagy in A549 and H1299 cells, as indicated by decreased levels of LC3 II/I and parkin markers and increased level of p62 protein. Furthermore, the inhibition caused reduction in mitochondrial autolysosomes and autophagic flux, as shown by TEM and live-cell imaging, respectively. In addition, PHB2 inhibition caused a remarkable increase in MMP and suppressed the proliferation and migration of A549 and H1299 cells. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that downregulation of PHB2 reduced parkin-mediated mitophagy, which suppressed proliferation and migration of A549 and H1299 cells.">

        <span class="abst" title="Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by neuroinflammation, leading to demyelination and axonal degeneration. Neuronal excitotoxity mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) results in neuronal damage in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of MS. Here, we define a critical role of excitatory neurons in the pathogenesis of CD4+ lymphocyte accumulation in EAE. We silenced the activity of excitatory neurons in a mouse model of targeted EAE using inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) under a CaMKIIα promoter. Neuronal silencing mitigated clinical disease scores in EAE, reduced the expression of c-fos, Tnfα, Ccl2, and Ccr2 mRNAs in targeted EAE lesions, and prevented the migration of CD4+ lymphocytes towards neurons. Ccl2 shRNA treatment of targeted EAE suppressed the migration of CD4+ lymphocytes and alleviated the motor deficits of EAE. Our findings indicate that neuronal activation in EAE promotes the migration of CCR2+ CD4+ lymphocytes and that neuronal silencing with an inhibitory DREADD alleviates clinical and molecular markers of disease. Neuronal CCL2 is thought to be involved in promoting lymphocytes migration.">

Once there, they can either aid in tissue regrowth or impart an immunomodulatory effect in the case of MSCs, or form secondary tumors in the case of tumor cells. During these journeys, cells experience physically confining forces that impinge on the cell body and the nucleus, ultimately causing a multitude of cellular changes. Most drastically, confining individual MSCs within hydrogels or confining monolayers of MSCs within agarose wells can sway MSC lineage commitment, while applying a confining compressive stress to metastatic tumor cells can increase their invasiveness. In this review, we seek to understand the signaling cascades that occur as cells sense confining forces and how that translates to behavioral changes, including elongated and multinucleated cell morphologies, novel migrational mechanisms, and altered gene expression, leading to a unique MSC secretome that could hold great promise for anti-inflammatory treatments. Through comparison of these altered behaviors, we aim to discern how MSCs alter their lineage selection, while tumor cells may become more aggressive and invasive. Synthesizing this information can be useful for employing MSCs for therapeutic approaches through systemic injections or tissue engineered grafts, and developing improved strategies for metastatic cancer therapies.">

We observed that EGOT is significantly down-regulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines, and EGOT expression is negatively correlated with the Ki67 expression. Overexpression of EGOT in BT549 cells decreased cell viability and migration. In addition, overexpression of EGOT resulted in decreases in expression of key genes in the Hh pathway, including Gli1, smoothened protein, protein patched homolog 1 and Hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP). Breast cancer tissues exhibited an increase in Gli1 expressions. Altered expression of Gli1, smoothened protein, protein patched homolog 1 and HHIP caused by EGOT overexpression were fully restored in cells transfected with plasmid complementory DNA (pcDNA) EGOT and treated with purmorphamine, an agonist of the Hh pathway.

We previously reported that CRM1 inhibition suppressed glioma cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the role of CRM1 in the migration and invasion of glioma cells. S109, a novel reversible selective inhibitor of CRM1, was used to treat Human glioma U87 and U251 cells. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound-healing and transwell invasion assays. The results showed that S109 significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of U87 and U251 cells. However, mutation of Cys528 in CRM1 abolished the inhibitory activity of S109 in glioma cells. Furthermore, we found that S109 treatment decreased the expression level and activity of MMP2 and reduced the level of phosphorylated STAT3 but not total STAT3. Therefore, the inhibition of migration and invasion induced by S109 may be associated with the downregulation of MMP2 activity and expression, and inactivation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. These results support our previous conclusion that inhibition of CRM1 is an attractive strategy for the treatment of glioma.">

However, it is not clear whether AUY922 affects events in vascular diseases. We investigated the effects of AUY922 on the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB-stimulated proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). VSMC viability was detected using the XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) reagent. To detect the attenuating effects of AUY922 on PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs migration in vitro, we performed the Boyden chamber and scratch wound healing assays. To identify AUY922-mediated changes in the signaling pathway, the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 was analyzed by immunoblotting. The inhibitory effects of AUY922 on migration and proliferation ex vivo were tested using an aortic ring assay. AUY922 was not cytotoxic at concentrations up to 5 nM. PDGF-BB-induced VSMC proliferation, migration, and sprout outgrowth were significantly decreased by AUY922 in a dose-dependent manner. AUY922 significantly reduced the PDGF-BB-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Furthermore, PD98059 (a selective ERK1/2 inhibitor) and LY294002 (a selective Akt inhibitor) decreased VSMC migration and proliferation by inhibiting phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. Greater attenuation of PDGF-BB-induced cell viability and migration was observed upon treatment with PD98059 or LY294002 in combination with AUY922. AUY922 showed anti-proliferation and anti-migration effects towards PDGF-BB-induced VSMCs by regulating the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Thus, AUY922 is a candidate for the treatment of atherosclerosis and restenosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary malignant bone tumor with a high rate of metastasis and a short 5-year survival rate. MiR-363 was downregulated in a variety of tumors and played a role in suppressing tumors. However, the roles of miR-363 in osteosarcoma remain unknown; thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the functions of miR-363 in osteosarcoma. METHODS:CCK-8 and transwell assays were performed to evaluate the proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of MG63 cells. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and apoptosis-associated proteins were measured by using Western blot assay. Luciferase reporter assay was utilized to verify whether miR-363 directly bound to the 3'-UTR of NOB1 mRNA. RESULTS:MiR-363 was downregulated while NOB1 was upregulated in osteosarcoma clinical tissue specimens and cell lines as compared with the adjacent normal tissue specimens and normal cell line. The miR-363 is reversely correlated with the expression of NOB1 in osteosarcoma tissues. Overexpression of miR-363 suppressed the ability of cell migration, invasion, and EMT, whereas low expression of miR-363 promoted this ability. In addition, miR-363 inhibited osteosarcoma proliferation both in vitro and in vivo and inhibited the apoptosis in MG63 cells. Interference of NOB1 could inhibit the migration, invasion, and EMT of osteosarcoma cell line MG63. NOB1 was verified to be a direct target of miR-363 and its expression was mediated by miR-363. Re-expression of NOB1 could partially reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-363 on cell migration and invasion. In addition, low expression of miR-363 or overexpression of NOB1 predicted poor prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. CONCLUSION:MiR-363 inhibited osteosarcoma the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT and induced the apoptosis by directly targeting NOB1 in MG63 cells. The newly identified miR-363/NOB1 axis provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.">

Eph receptors comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine and display dual role in tumor progression due to unique ephrin cis- or trans- signaling. The roles of EphB1 and its phosphorylation signaling in lung cancer remain to be elucidated. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the expression of EphB1 in both publicly available database and 60 cases of NSCLC patients with or without metastasis. The migration and invasion of lung cancer cells were assessed by a transwell assay. The activation of EphB1 signaling was assessed by western blot and real-time PCR. The EphB1 mutant was used to evaluate the effect of phosphorylation of EphB1. Results: Here, we showed that increased expression of EphB1 was detected in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) biopies compared to non-cancer controls. Significant higher expression of EphB1 in lung biopsies were found in patients with metastasis compared to non-metastatic NSCLC patients. Higher EphB1 expression was correlated with poor patient survival in lung cancer. Overexpression of EphB1 promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. On the contrast, Ephrin-B2, a transmembrane ligand for EphB1 forward signaling, inhibited migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. TGF-β-activated Smad2 transcriptionally upregulated the endogenous expression of EphB1. Ligand-independent EphB1 promoted Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through upregulating CDH2. Conclusion: Our results showed that the effect of EphB1 on the migration and invasion was context-specific and was dependent on EphB1 phosphorylation.">

        <span class="abst" title="Great Egret Ardea alba is one of few Western Palearctic species that underwent a rapid range expansion in the recent decades. Originally breeding in central and eastern Europe, the species has spread in northern (up to the Baltic coast) and western (up to the western France) directions and established viable breeding populations throughout almost entire continent. We monitored one of the first Great Egrets colonies established in Poland to infer migratory patterns and survival rates directly after range expansion. For this purpose, we collected resightings from over 200 Great Egret chicks marked between 2002-2017 in central Poland. Direction of migration was non-random, as birds moved almost exclusively into the western direction. Wintering grounds were located mainly in the western Europe (Germany to France) within 800-950 km from the breeding colony. First-year birds migrated farther than adults. We found some, although relatively weak, support for age-dependent survival of Great Egrets and under the best-fitted capture-recapture model, the estimated annual survival rate of adults was nearly twice higher than for first-year birds (φ ad  = 0.85 ± 0.05 vs. φ fy  = 0.48 ± 0.15). Annual survival rate under the constant model (no age-related variation) was estimated at φ = 0.81 ± 0.05. Our results suggest that Great Egrets rapidly adapted to novel ecological and environmental conditions during range expansion. We suggest that high survival rate of birds from central Poland and their western direction of migration may facilitate further colonization processes in western Europe.">

Nevertheless, they can also have a negative effect on the immune system. This study is aimed at investigating the influence of these substances on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), whose nonspecific defense mechanisms can promote thrombogenesis. Methods:Blood samples from 30 healthy volunteers were investigated, whereby PMNs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and incubated with 0.8 μg/mL of argatroban, 1.0 U/mL of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), 1.0 U/mL of unfractionated heparin (UFH), or without drug (control). A collagen-cell mixture was prepared and filled into 3D μ-slide chemotaxis chambers (IBIDI® GmbH, Germany). Stimulation was initiated by using a chemokine gradient of n-formyl-methionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), and microscopic observation was conducted for 4.5 hours. The cells' track length and track straightness, as well as the number of attracted granulocytes, level of ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, and NET (neutrophil extracellular traps) formation, were analyzed and categorized into migration distances and time periods. Results:All three anticoagulants led to significantly reduced PMN track lengths, with UFH having the biggest impact. The number of tracks observed in the UFH group were significantly reduced compared to the control group. Additionally, the UFH group demonstrated a significantly lower track straightness compared to the control. ROS production and NET formation were unaffected. Conclusion:Our data provide evidence that anticoagulants have an inhibitory effect on the extent of PMN migration and chemotactic migration efficiency, thus indicating their potential immune-modulatory and prothrombotic effects.">

Here, we show that the adaptor protein CrkL, but not the closely related family members CrkI or CrkII, is a crucial regulator of T cell migration. In vitro, CrkL-deficient T cells fail to polymerize actin in response to the integrin ligand ICAM-1, resulting in defective migration. Using a mouse model of GvHD/GVT, we found that while CrkL-deficient T cells can efficiently eliminate hematopoietic tumors they are unable to migrate into inflamed organs, such as the liver and small intestine, and thus do not cause GvHD. These results suggest a specific role for CrkL in trafficking to peripheral organs but not the lymphatic system. In line with this, we found that although CrkL-deficient T cells could clear hematopoietic tumors, they failed to clear the same tumor growing subcutaneously, highlighting the role of CrkL in controlling T cell migration into peripheral tissues. Our results define a unique role for CrkL in controlling T cell migration, and suggest that CrkL function could be therapeutically targeted to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies involving allogeneic donor cells.">

        <span class="abst" title="Purpose:Radiation has well-known and well-characterized direct toxic effects on cells and tissues. However, low-dose ionizing irradiation (LDIR) can also enhance the invasion and migration of tumor cells, and the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate changes induced in the migration and invasion of A549 cells after LDIR and to explore the potential molecular mechanism. Materials and Methods:A549 cells were irradiated with X-rays at different doses (0, 2, 4, and 6 Gy) and cultured for 24 or 48 h. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase release, CCK8, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays. Wound-healing and transwell assays were performed to detect migration and invasion ability. CXCL1 or p65 were knocked down using lentivirus-mediated siRNA in A549 cell lines. Knockdown efficiency of CXCL1 and p65 was assessed by RT-qPCR. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were used to determine the changes in protein levels. Results:In cells irradiated with a dose of 6 Gy, after 48 h, apoptosis was clearly induced while proliferation was inhibited. Irradiation with 4 Gy resulted in the upregulation of CXCL1 expression and activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, upon 4 Gy irradiation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were significantly enhanced in A549 cells. Importantly, CXCL1 or p65 knockdown inhibited radiation-induced migration, invasion, and EMT. Conclusion:Low-dose radiation upregulates CXCL1 expression and activates the NF-κB signaling to regulate EMT in A549 cells, thereby promoting invasion and migration. These results provide new insights into the prevention of tumor invasion and metastasis induced by radiotherapy.">

Leukocytes are specialized in sensing a variety of guidance cues and to integrate environmental stimuli to navigate in a timely and spatially controlled manner. These extracellular signals must be transmitted across the leukocyte's plasma membrane in a way that intracellular signaling cascades enable directional cell movement. Therefore, the composition of the membrane in concert with proteins that influence the compartmentalization of the plasma membrane or contribute to delineate intracellular signaling molecules are key in controlling leukocyte navigation. This becomes evident by the fact that mislocalization of membrane proteins is known to deleteriously affect cellular functions that may cause diseases. In this review we summarize recent advances made in the understanding of how membrane cholesterol levels modulate chemokine receptor signaling and hence leukocyte trafficking. Moreover, we provide an overview on the role of membrane scaffold proteins, particularly tetraspanins, flotillins/reggies, and caveolins in controlling leukocyte migration both in vitro and in vivo.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting females worldwide; however, its etiology mechanism remains unclear. In various malignancies, miR-145-5p is a widely accepted and versatile miRNA. Therefore, our research focused on exploring the activity and etiology of miR-145-5p in the modulation of metastasis, migration, and proliferation of EOC cells. The direct reactions between the 3'UTRs of SMAD4 mRNA and miR-145-5p were verified using dual luciferase reporter test. SKOV-3 cells were subsequently transfected using miR-145-5p mimics. Cell migration, death, and proliferation were evaluated using MTT, flow cytometry, and Transwell test. In addition, SMAD4 transcription and translation were evaluated using qRT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS:We found that miR-145-5p expression was repressed prevalently in EOC tissues, apart from SMAD4 upregulation. Excessive miR-145-5p expression remarkably reinforced EOC cell death and repressed EOC cell proliferation. Furthermore, upregulated miR-145-5p expression noticeably repressed migration via MMP-2 and MMP-9 downregulation. Moreover, SMAD4 was downregulated via miR-145-5p transfection. The dual luciferase test revealed that miR-145-5p directly targeted SMAD4. CONCLUSIONS:Our research suggests that miR-145-5p serves as a malignancy repressor and exerts an essential impact on inhibiting malignancy generation and reinforcing EOC death via targeting SMAD4. MiR-145-5p application could serve as a promising strategy to treat EOC.">

Early diagnosis and therapeutic interventions targeting NSCLC is becoming the world's significant challenge. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as a group of potential cancer biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to examine the expression of circ_0072309 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), wound healing and Transwell assays were used to analyze cell proliferation, migration and invasion in A549 and H1299 cells. The relationship between circ_0072309 and miR-580-3 was analyzed by Luciferase reporter and RNA pull down assays. RESULTS:We screened circ_0072309 from Gene Expression Omnibus and found that circ_0072309 was lowly expressed in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. The transfection of circ_0072309-overexpressing vector significantly suppressed the cell proliferation, migration and invasion in A549 and H1299 cells. We predicted that miR-580-3p is a target of circ_0072309 by using publicly available bioinformatic algorithms Circinteractome tool and confirmed that circ_0072309 directly bound to miR-580-3p. Furthermore, the addition of miR-580-3p mitigated the blockage of cell proliferation, migration and invasion induced by circ_0072309. CONCLUSIONS:These data showed that circ_0072309 inhibits the progression of NSCLC progression via blocking the expression of miR-580-3p. These findings revealed the anti-tumor role of circ_0072309 during the development of NSCLC and provided a novel diagnostic biomarker and potential therapy for NSCLC.">

        <span class="abst" title="Collective cell migration is central to many developmental and pathological processes. However, the mechanisms that keep cell collectives together and coordinate movement of multiple cells are poorly understood. Using the Drosophila border cell migration model, we find that Protein phosphatase 1 (Pp1) activity controls collective cell cohesion and migration. Inhibition of Pp1 causes border cells to round up, dissociate, and move as single cells with altered motility. We present evidence that Pp1 promotes proper levels of cadherin-catenin complex proteins at cell-cell junctions within the cluster to keep border cells together. Pp1 further restricts actomyosin contractility to the cluster periphery rather than at individual internal border cell contacts. We show that the myosin phosphatase Pp1 complex, which inhibits non-muscle myosin-II (Myo-II) activity, coordinates border cell shape and cluster cohesion. Given the high conservation of Pp1 complexes, this study identifies Pp1 as a major regulator of collective versus single cell migration.">

This study aimed to clarify the effect of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) on CC progression and the potential mechanism. Methods:CC cell lines HCT116 and HT29 were selected for functional analysis. The expression of MALAT1, microRNA (miR)-101-3p, and stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) in CC tissues and cells were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), ﻿flow cytometry, wound scratch and ﻿transwell assay, respectively. The target relationships (MALAT1 and miR-101-3p, miR-101-3p and STC1) were validated by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assay. Results:The expression of MALAT1 was elevated in CC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and was associated with lymph node metastasis, depth of invasion and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Up-regulation of MALAT1 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibited the apoptosis of CC cells; while MALAT1 knockdown exhibited opposite results. MiR-101-3p was a target of MALAT1, which was negatively regulated by MALAT1. Silencing of miR-101-3p reverses the anti-tumor effect of MALAT1 knockdown on CC cells. STC1 was a target of miR-101-3p, which was negatively regulated by miR-101-3p. Silencing of STC1 reverses the tumor promoting effects of MALAT1 up-regulation and miR-101-3p down-regulation on CC cells. Conclusion:MALAT1 may function as an oncogene in CC progression by affecting the miR-101-3p/STC1 axis, providing a hopeful therapeutic option for CC.">

Detection of NUDT21 expression may lead to the identification of a novel marker for breast cancer. Purpose:The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance and functional role of NUDT21 in breast cancer. Methods:The protein expression of NUDT21 was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 100 paraffin-embedded, archived breast cancer samples and 100 benign breast tissues. Then, the correlations between the NUDT21 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses of the breast cancer patients were analyzed. In addition, the function of NUDT21 in breast cancer cell lines was detected by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium, colony formation and ﻿t﻿ranswell assays. Finally, mass spectrometry analysis and Western blotting were used to identify the proteins that interact directly with NUDT21. Results:IHC analysis revealed that the expression of NUDT21 was significantly lower in breast cancer tissues compared with benign breast disease tissues. The correlation analysis revealed that low expression of NUDT21 was positively correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. Also, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients with lower NUDT21 expression had shorter overall survival and relapse-free survival compared with higher NUDT21 expression. In addition, the knockdown of NUDT21 enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Consistently, the overexpression of NUDT21 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT. In addition, NUDT21 directly interacted with CPSF6 and negatively regulated its expression. Moreover, the knockdown of CPSF6 reversed NUDT21 expression-induced cancer cell migration and invasion. Conclusion:NUDT21 might play a tumor-suppressive role by inhibiting cell proliferation and invasion via the NUDT21/CPSF6 signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.">

It can be obtained from daily food intake or synthesized in the body through the urea cycle using l-citrulline as a substrate. Arginine has a versatile role in the body because it helps in cell division, wound healing, ammonia disposal, immune system, and hormone biosynthesis. It is noteworthy that l-arginine is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and polyamines. In the case of cancer cells, arginine de novo synthesis is not enough to compensate for their high nutritional needs, forcing them to rely on extracellular supply of arginine. In this review, we will go through the importance of arginine deprivation as a novel targeting therapy by discussing the different arginine deprivation agents and their mechanism of action. We will also focus on the factors that affect cell migration and on the influence of arginine on metastases through polyamine and NO.">

        <span class="abst" title="Metastasis, the leading cause of death in cancer patients, requires the invasion of tumor cells through the stroma in response to migratory cues, in part provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent advances in proteomics have led to the identification of hundreds of ECM proteins, which are more abundant in tumors relative to healthy tissue. Our goal was to develop a pipeline to easily predict which ECM proteins are more likely to have an effect on cancer invasion and metastasis. We evaluated the effect of four ECM proteins upregulated in breast tumor tissue in multiple human breast cancer cell lines in three assays. There was no linear relationship between cell adhesion to ECM proteins and ECM-driven 2D cell migration speed, persistence, or 3D invasion. We then used classifiers and partial-least squares regression analysis to identify which metrics best predicted ECM-driven 2D migration and 3D invasion responses. We find that ECM-driven 2D cell migration speed or persistence did not predict 3D invasion in response to the same cue. However, cell adhesion, and in particular cell elongation and shape irregularity, accurately predicted the magnitude of ECM-driven 2D migration and 3D invasion. Our models successfully predicted the effect of novel ECM proteins in a cell-line specific manner. Overall, our studies identify the cell morphological features that determine 3D invasion responses to individual ECM proteins. This platform will help provide insight into the functional role of ECM proteins abundant in tumor tissue and help prioritize strategies for targeting tumor-ECM interactions to treat metastasis.">

In this study, we observed that HDAC7 was significantly upregulated in the NPC tissues relative to normal nasopharyngeal mucosa (NNM) tissues, HDAC7 expression levels were positively correlated with NPC progression and negatively correlated with patient prognosis, and HDAC7 knockdown dramatically inhibited the in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of NPC cells, and the growth of NPC xenografts in mice, indicating the HDAC7 promotes the oncogenicity of NPC. Mechanistically, HDAC7 promoted the in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of NPC cells by upregulating EphA2, in which miR-4465 mediated HDAC7-regulating EphA2, a direct target gene of miR-4465. We further showed that miR-4465 was significantly downregulated in the NPC tissues relative to NNM tissues, and inhibited the in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of NPC cells by targeting EphA2 expression. Moreover, we observed that the expressions of HDAC7, miR-4465, and EphA2 in NPC tissues were correlated. The results suggest that HDAC7 promotes the oncogenicity of NPC by downregulating miR-4465 and subsequently upregulating EphA2, highlighting HDAC7 as a potential therapeutic target for NPC.">

MiR-637 exerts an antiproliferative effect on multiple human cells. Its impact on atherosclerosis remains largely unexplored. Methods:Real-time PCR was used to determine miR-637 expression in samples from atherosclerosis patients and animal models. Its expression in VSMC dysfunction models (induced by ox-LDL) was also measured. The proliferation and migration of VSMCs were respectively tested using CCK-8 and Transwell assays, and apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. The Targetscan database was used to predict the target genes of miR-637. Interaction between miR-637 and the potential target gene was validated via real-time PCR, western blotting and a luciferase reporter assay. Results:MiR-637 expression was significantly lower in atherosclerosis patient and animal model samples. It also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner in animal models with ox-LDL-induced atherosclerosis. Transfection with miR-637 mimics suppressed the proliferation and migration of VSMCs while promoting apoptosis, while transfection with miR-637 inhibitors had the opposite effects. We also validated that insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-2), a crucial factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, serves as a target gene for miR-637. Conclusion:MiR-637 targeting IGF-2 contributes to atherosclerosis inhibition and could be a potential target for this disease.">

Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level) to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling approach addresses a significant lack of migration data at administrative unit levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded. Due to the widespread availability of census-based migration microdata at the Admin-1 level, our modeling approach opens up for the possibilities of modeling migration patterns at Admin-2 and Admin-3 levels across many other countries where such data are currently lacking.">

We present satellite tracking data on common cuckoos experimentally displaced 1,800 km eastward from Rybachy to Kazan. After displacement, both young and adult travelled similarly towards the route of non-displaced control birds. The tracking data demonstrate the potential for young common cuckoos to return to the species-specific migration route after displacement, a response so far reported exclusively in experienced birds. Our results indicate that an inherited map allows first-time migrating cuckoos to locate suitable wintering grounds.

Colder sea surface temperature anomalies the previous season were correlated with greater krill biomass the following year, and earlier arrival by blue whales. Our results demonstrate a plastic response of blue whales to interannual variability and the importance of krill as a driving force behind migration timing. A decadal-scale increase in temperature due to climate change has led to blue whales extending their overall time in Southern California. By the end of our 10-year study, whales were arriving at the feeding grounds more than one month earlier, while their departure date did not change.

M2b macrophages, which are different from M1 and M2 macrophages, are believed to have immunomodulatory activities and produce little fibrosis. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of M2b macrophages on pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) derived from monocrotaline-induced PAH rats. Methods:PASMCs were cultured in serum-free medium, the supernatant of M0 macrophages, or the supernatant of M2b macrophages for 24 hours. Then cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting kit-8 and cell migration ability was detected by wound healing and transwell assays. The apoptosis rate of cells was determined by TUNEL staining and annexin V-PE/7-ADD staining. Western blot was used to detect the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, cleaved caspase-9 and PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway. LY294002 (a specific inhibitor of PI3K) was used to investigate its effect on PASMCs and its relationship with M2b macrophages. Results:Conditioned medium from M2b macrophages significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of PASMCs compared with the control group and M0 macrophage group. Furthermore, conditioned medium from M2b macrophages promote PASMC apoptosis and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved caspase-9, inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. Finally, conditioned medium from M2b macrophages inhibited the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway also significantly inhibit the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis resistance of PASMCs. Conclusion:Conditioned medium from M2b macrophages can inhibit the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis resistance of PASMCs, which may be at least partially by deregulating the PI3K/Akt/FoxO3a pathway.">

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractThe tumor homing characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) make them attractive vehicles for the tumor-specific delivery of therapeutic agents, such as the sodium iodide symporter (NIS). NIS is a theranostic protein that allows non-invasive monitoring of the in vivo biodistribution of functional NIS expression by radioiodine imaging as well as the therapeutic application of 131I. To enhance the actively recruitment of MSCs to growing tumor stroma and thereby trigger targeted delivery of the NIS gene to the tumor, we examined the combination with regional hyperthermia, as heat induces the secretion of immunomodulatory chemokines, cytokines and growth factors, well-known attractants of MSCs.Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HuH7) were heat-treated in a water bath at 41 °C for 1h, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 0-48h. mRNA and protein levels of chemokines involved in MSC migration was analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA. Chemotaxis of MSCs in relation to a gradient of supernatants was tested in a 3D live cell tracking migration assay. In a subcutaneous HuH7 mouse xenograft tumor model, a single systemic injection of CMV-NIS-MSCs was applied 6h, 24h, 48h after or 24h, 48h before hyperthermia treatment and tumoral 123I accumulation was assessed by 123I-scintigraphy. Ex vivo NIS analysis of tumor sections was performed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The optimal imaging regime was then used for a 131I therapy study.Chemokine mRNA and protein analysis indicated a substantial increase in expression levels of chemokines and growth factors, involved in MSC tumor homing, after heat exposure. In addition, MSCs showed directed migration towards the supernatant of thermo-stimulated cancer cells. In vivo, with the optimal regime, we observed a significantly increased uptake of 123I in tumors of heat-treated animals (41 °C) when thermostimulated 24h after CMV-NIS-MSC injection compared to control animals (37 °C). Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections showed strong tumoral NIS-specific immunoreactivity and RT-PCR an increased NIS mRNA expression in heat-treated tumors, thereby confirming tumor-selective, temperature-dependent MSC migration. CMV-NIS-MSC-mediated 131I therapy combined with regional hyperthermia resulted in a reduced tumor growth that was associated with prolonged survival of regional heat-treated animals compared to normothermic mice and to the saline control group.In summary, we have demonstrated a significantly increased, selective MSC migration towards the tumor stroma after regional hyperthermia in the 123I imaging study. The combination of MSC-mediated NIS gene therapy with mild regional hyperthermia resulting in stimulated therapeutic efficacy of NIS-mediated 131I therapy.">

In contrast, TCF21 promotes increased expression of LRH-1 in hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2 cells, by binding to the Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP/NR0B2) promoter region, an LRH-1 negative regulator. Epigenetic alteration induced TCF21 loss of function and has been associated with increased of cellular migration and invasion. In ACC, TCF21 promoter is hypermethylated and less expressed. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of TCF21 by expressing or silencing TCF21 in adrenocortical pediatric adenoma, ACA-T7 cells, in ACC cell lines SW-13 and H295R cell line, and in HepG2 cell line. Were used CRISPR/dCas9/TCF21 and pCMVMycPOD1 or siRNATCF21 to express and silence TCF21, respectively. Increased expression of TCF21 in H295RpCMVMycPOD1 and SW-13CRISPR/dCas9/TCF21 cells resulted in significantly decreased cell migration and invasion (53.2±36.1%/70.8±26.5% and 82.6±4.2%/100%, respectively). In ACA-T7/siRNATCF21 cells, the inhibition of TCF21 resulted in significant increase migration and invasion capacity (45.0±12.7%/33.1±17.4%) compared with ACA-T7 cells. Higher TCF21 expression in HepG2CRISPR/dCas9/TCF21 increased invasion [147.08±16.54% (p&lt;0.0001)]. Analysis of metalloproteinase genes expression showed that TCF21 significantly (p&lt;0.01) increased MMP8 expression in SW-13CRISPR/dCas9/TCF21 and H295R/pCMVMycPod-1 whereas decreased MMP9 and MMP2 (p&lt; 0.0001). The opposite effect was observed in ACA-T7/siRNATCF21. Moreover, in HepG2CRISPR/dCas9/TCF21 cells was observed an increase of MMP2 and MMP9 expression (p&lt;0.001). These results suggest that TCF21 regulate epithelial mesenchymal transition and vice versa (EMT/MET) in tumors depending on cellular context. Supported by Fapesp and Capes.">

TR and ER are involved in Purkinje cells dendrite growth, spines and synapse formation. They also regulate the functional maturation, intracellular metabolism, and migration of neuron and glial. Soybean isoflavones especially genistein, daidzein, and daidzein metabolite, S-equol were known to exert their action through TR, ER, and GPR30, that is a G-protein-coupled ER. However, the mechanisms of soybean isoflavone action on cerebellar development and function have not yet been extensively studied. We evaluated the effects of soybean isoflavone, such as genistein, daidzein, and S-equol, using mouse primary cerebellar culture, astrocyte-enriched culture, and C6 clonal cells. Soybean isoflavone augmented TH- or estradiol (E2)-mediated dendrite arborization of Purkinje cells. Such augmentation was suppressed by G15, a selective G-protein coupled ER (GPR30) antagonist, and ICI 182.780, an antagonist for ERs in both cultures. It also increased mRNA expression level of TH-responsive genes including Mbp, Bdnf, Rc3, Ntf3, Camk2b, and Hr. Moreover, genistein and daidazein also increased mRNA expression level of Syn1, Syp and Psd95 that are involved in synaptic plasticity.On the other hand, in astrocytes, soybean isoflavone activated cell migration and F-actin rearrangements. Such effects were suppressed by G15, but not by ICI 182.780. Knockdown of GPR30 by RNAi also suppressed the cells migration. Protein expression levels of p-Akt (Ser473), p-Rac1/cdc42 (Ser71), RhoA, Rac1/2/3, and cdc42 also increased by soybean isoflavone. Co-exposure with Rhosin HCl, a selective RhoA inhibitor, reduced the cells migration and formation of stress fibers. These findings indicate that sobybean isoflavone may affect cerebellar development by acting to both neurons and astrocytes through several signaling pathways, including TR, ER, and GPR30.Keywords:EDC, ER, TR, GPR30, Neuron, Astrocyte">

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractThe effect of androgen on angiogenesis has been documented. However, its molecular mechanisms underlying has not been well illustrated. Here, we conducted both in vitro migration assay and proliferation assay to investigate whether androgen receptor activation have any impacts on the angiogenesis. Treatment with an androgen receptor (AR) agonist, metribolone (R1881) at a range of concentrations (0.05-5 nM) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) at a range of concentrations (0.5-2 nM) caused concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation and migration in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC). Blockade of the AR activity by pre-treatment with HF (5 nM), an AR antagonist, or knockdown of AR expression using the lenti-virus shRNA technique abolished the R1881-induced proliferation and migration inhibition in HUVEC, suggesting that AR receptor activation can inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration. To further delineate the signaling pathway involved in the AR activation-induced proliferation inhibition, our data indicate that R1881 inhibited proliferation in vascular endothelial cells through activating the AR/cSrc/AKT/p38/ERK/NFκB signaling pathway, which in turn up-regulated the expression of p53, p21 and p27 protein, and finally reduced endothelial cell proliferation. To investigate signaling pathway involved in the AR activation-induced migration inhibition, our data showed that R1881 can reduce the membrane translocation of RhoA and Rac-1, suggesting that inhibition of the RhoA and Rac-1 activity might be involved in the R1881-inhibited endothelial cell migration. Over-expression of RhoA prevented the R1881-inhibited endothelial cell migration and this effect was abolished by pre-treatment with Y27623, a ROCK inhibitor, confirming that inhibiting RhoA activity participated in the R1881-inhibited endothelial cell migration. Using the zebrafish and Matrigel angiogenesis models, we also demonstrated that R1881 inhibited angiogenesis through the AR-mediated pathway in vivo.">

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractPeripheral nerve injury is a problem affecting millions of people worldwide, causing significant disability and a reduction in the quality of life. The neurons of the peripheral nervous system are characterized by a significant regeneration capability. However, the functional recovery is unsatisfactory in most cases, making the identification of new strategies to improve the regenerative outcome a major medical need. Schwann cells (SCs), the main neuroglial cells of the peripheral nervous system, trans-differentiate after nerve injury towards a phenotype, known as the repair phenotype, that promotes nerve regeneration. Nonetheless, adult human SCs have poor expansion capability in vitro, undermining their potential clinical development. Several studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells, especially when differentiated into a Schwann cell-like (SCL) phenotype, may represent an alternative to primary SCs, promoting pro-regenerative effects both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs), members of the progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, have been shown to be present and active in Schwann cells. Progesterone activates mPRs in SCs to promote cell migration and proliferation, change cell morphology, and modulate the expression of key SC differentiation factors. These findings suggest a possible role for mPRs in nerve repair. The goal of the present project is to study the role of mPRs in the promotion of pro-regenerative effects in mesenchymal adipose stem cells (ASC), both undifferentiated (uASC) and after differentiation toward the SCL phenotype (SCL-ASC). We first characterized uASC and SCL-ASC, confirming that the latter showed increased expression of SC markers like S100B, Sox10, GFAP, P0 and Krox20, alongside a more pronounced spindle-like shape leading to an increased aspect ratio. The differentiation protocol also increased mPR gene expression in SCL-ASC compared to uASC, especially mPRα (PAQR7) and mPRβ (PAQR8). Treatment with the specific mPR agonist Org OD 02-0 (02-0) caused cell elongation in SCL-ASC, mimicking what happens to SCs in vivo when they trans-differentiate towards the repair phenotype. 02-0 treatment also led to increased cell migration and cell proliferation in both uASC and SCL-ASC, consistent with a pro-regenerative role of mPRs. The effect was more rapid and evident in SCL-ASC. Lastly, we analyzed the effect of mPR activation on neutrophin production and release in uASC and SCL-ASC. A significant increase was observed in the expression and release of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whose role in promoting neurogenesis is well established. Our results support the hypothesis that mPRs have an important role in the modulation of uASC and SCL-ASC physiology and their activation may promote nerve regeneration.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Percutaneous coronary intervention represents the most important treatment modality of coronary artery stenosis. In-stent restenosis (ISR) is still a limitation for the long-term outcome despite the introduction of drug eluting stents. It has been shown that adipokines directly influence vessel wall homeostasis by influencing the function of endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells. Visceral adipose tissue-derived serpin vaspin was recently identified as a member of serine protease inhibitor family and serveral studies could demonstrate a relation to metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate a role of vaspin in the development of in-stent restenosis in vivo and on migration of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells in vitro. METHODS:We studied 85 patients with stable coronary artery disease who underwent elective and successful PCI with implatation of drug eluting stents. Blood samples were taken directly before PCI. Vaspin plasma levels were measured by specific ELISA. ISR was evaluated eight months later by coronary angiography. Human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) migration was analyzed by an in-vitro migration assay with different concentrations (0.004ng/mL up to 40ng/mL) of vaspin as well as by an scratch assay. For proliferation an impedance measurement with specialiced E-Plates was performed. RESULTS:During the follow up period, 14 patients developed ISR. Patients with ISR had significantly lower vaspin plasma levels compared to patients without ISR (0.213 ng/ml vs 0.382 ng/ml; p = 0.001). In patients with plasma vaspin levels above 1.35 ng/ml we could not observe any restenosis. There was also a significant correlation of plasma vaspin levels and late lumen loss in the stented coronary segments. Further we could demonstrate that vaspin nearly abolishes serum induced migration of HCASMC (100% vs. 9%; p&lt;0.001) in a biphasic manner but not migration of HUVEC. Proliferation of HCASMC and HUVEC was not modulated by vaspin treatment. CONCLUSION:We were able to show that the adipokine vaspin selectively inhibits human coronary SMC migration in vitro and has no effect on HUVEC migration. Vaspin had no effect on proliferation of HUVEC which is an important process of the healing of the stented vessel. In addition, the occurrence of ISR after PCI with implantation of drug eluting stents was significantly associated with low vaspin plasma levels before intervention. Determination of vaspin plasma levels before PCI might be helpful in the identification of patients with high risk for development of ISR after stent implantation. In addition, the selective effects of vaspin on smooth muscle cell migration could potentially be used to reduce ISR without inhibition of re-endothelialization of the stented segment.">

Here, we report that tail-following behavior at the contact site, termed contact following locomotion (CFL), can induce a non-trivial collective behavior in migrating cells. We show the emergence of a traveling band showing polar order in a mutant Dictyostelium cell that lacks chemotactic activity. We find that CFL is the cell-cell interaction underlying this phenomenon, enabling a theoretical description of how this traveling band forms. We further show that the polar order phase consists of subpopulations that exhibit characteristic transversal motions with respect to the direction of band propagation. These findings describe a novel mechanism of collective cell migration involving cell-cell interactions capable of inducing traveling band with polar order.">

Investigating the signaling pathways that maintain cancer cell phenotype can identify new biomarkers for targeted therapy. Aberrant transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling has been implicated in CRC progression, however, the exact mechanism by which TGFβ exerts its function is still being unraveled. Herein, we investigated TAGLN expression, prognostic value, and its regulation by TGFβ in CRC. While TAGLN was generally found to be downregulated in CRC, elevated expression of TAGLN was associated with advanced CRC stage and predicted poor overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.8, log-rank test P-value = 0.014) and disease-free survival (HR = 1.6, log-rank test P-value = 0.046), hence implicating TAGLN as poor prognostic factor in CRC. Forced expression of TAGLN was associated with enhanced CRC cell proliferation, clonogenic growth, cell migration and in vivo tumor formation in immunocompromised mice, while targeted depletion of TAGLN exhibited opposing biological effects. Global gene expression profiling of TAGLN-overexpressing or TAGLN-deficient CRC cell lines revealed deregulation of multiple cancer-related genes and signaling pathways. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed ultrastructural changes due to loss of TAGLN, including disruption of actin cytoskeleton organization and aberrant actin filament distribution. Hierarchical clustering, principle component, and ingenuity pathway analyses revealed distinct molecular profile associated with TAGLNhigh CRC patients with remarkable activation of a number of mechanistic networks, including SMARCA4, TGFβ1, and P38 MAPK. The P38 MAPK was the top predicted upstream regulator network promoting cell movement through regulation of several intermediate molecules, including TGFβ1. Concordantly, functional categories associated with cellular movement and angiogenesis were also enriched in TAGLNhigh CRC, supporting a model for the molecular mechanisms linking TGFβ-induced upregulation of TAGLN and CRC tumor progression and suggesting TAGLN as potential prognostic marker associated with advanced CRC pathological stage.">

        <span class="abst" title="Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common adult kidney cancer, and accounts for 85% of all cases of kidney cancers worldwide. Praeruptorin B (Pra-B) is a bioactive constituent of Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn and exhibits several pharmacological activities, including potent antitumor effects. However, the anti-RCC effects of Pra-B and their underlying mechanisms are unclear; therefore, we explored the effects of Pra-B on RCC cells in this study. We found that Pra-B nonsignificantly influenced the cell viability of human RCC cell lines 786-O and ACHN at a dose of less than 30 μM for 24 h treatment. Further study revealed that Pra-B potently inhibited the migration and invasion of 786-O and ACHN cells, as well as downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of cathepsin C (CTSC) and cathepsin V (CTSV) of 786-O and ACHN cells. Mechanistically, Pra-B also reduced the protein levels of phospho (p)-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and p-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in RCC cells. In addition, Pra-B treatment inhibited the effect of EGF on the upregulation of EGFR-MEK-ERK, CTSC and CTSV expression, cellular migration, and invasion of 786-O cells. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that Pra-B can reduce the migration and invasion ability of human RCC cells through suppressing the EGFR-MEK-ERK signaling pathway and subsequently downregulating CTSC and CTSV. This evidence suggests that Pra-B can be developed as an effective antimetastatic agent for the treatment of RCC.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Healing of tendons after injury involves the proliferation of tenocytes and the production of extracellular matrix; however, their capacity to heal is limited by poor cell density and limited growth factor activity. Flightless I (Flii) has previously been identified as an important regulator of cellular proliferation and migration, and the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of differential Flii gene expression on tenocyte function in vitro. METHODS:The role of Flii on tenocyte proliferation, migration, and contraction was assessed using established assays. Tenocytes from Flii+/-, wild-type, and Flii overexpressing mice were obtained and the effect of differential Flii expression on migration, proliferation, contraction, and collagen synthesis determined in vitro. Statistical differences were determined using unpaired Student's t test and statistical outliers were identified using the Grubbs' test. RESULTS:Flii overexpressing tenocytes showed significantly improved migration and proliferation as well as increased collagen I secretion. Explanted tendons from Flii overexpressing mice also showed significantly elevated tenocyte outgrowth compared to Flii+/- mice. In contrast to its role in dermal wound repair, Flii positively affects cellular processes in tendons. CONCLUSIONS:These findings suggest that Flii could be a novel target for modulating tenocyte activity and improving tendon repair. This could have significant clinical implications as novel therapeutic targets for improved healing of tendon injuries are urgently needed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Keratinocytes and neutrophils are the main cellular components in wound healing during re-epithelization and inflammation. Free fatty acids such as linoleic acid (LA) present beneficial properties for wound healing by modulating the inflammatory response. LA is a natural ligand of free fatty acids receptor 1 (FFA1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), able to modulate inflammatory process; however, the role of FFA1 in keratinocytes and wound healing remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of FFA1 signaling in migration, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity, and IL-8 expression induced by LA in keratinocytes. We confirmed that HaCaT cells, a human keratinocyte cell line, expresses the FFA1 receptor and GW1100, a selective antagonist of FFA1, decreased LA-induced migration of HaCaT cells. Also, GW9508, a synthetic agonist of FFA1, increased migration of these cells. Furthermore, ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK inhibitors abolished the LA-induced increase in cell migration. Besides, HaCaT cells stimulated with LA or GW9508 increased the activity of MMP-9 and the expression of IL-8. GW1100 partially inhibited both responses. We further evaluated the effects of HaCaT cells conditioned media stimulated with LA or GW9508 on neutrophil chemotaxis. Conditioned media induced neutrophil chemotaxis. Furthermore, IL-8 secreted by HaCaT cells stimulated with LA or GW9508, contributed to neutrophil chemotaxis. In conclusion, LA increased migration, MMP-9 activity, and expression of IL-8 from HaCaT cells via FFA1. Hence, these results showed that the effects induced by LA in keratinocytes can be mediated through FFA1, thus explaining a possible mechanism by which this fatty acid could accelerate wound healing.">

Although duodenal perforations secondary to the biliary plastic stent are quite rare, they can be life-threatening. The treatment strategies for such perforations are diverse and continue to be debated. CASE PRESENTATION:We report three cases of duodenal perforation due to the migration of biliary plastic stents that were successfully managed using an endoscope. The three patients were admitted on complaints of abdominal pain after they underwent ERBD. Abdominal computerized tomography (CT) revealed migration of the biliary plastic stents and perforation of the duodenum. Endoscopy was immediately performed, and perforation was confirmed. All migrated stents were successfully extracted endoscopically by using snares. In two of the three cases, the duodenal defects were successfully closed with haemostatic clips after stent retrieval, and subsequently, endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tubes were inserted. After the endoscopy and medical treatment, all three patients recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS:Duodenal perforations due to the migration of biliary stents are rare, and the treatment strategies remain controversial. Our cases and cases in the literature demonstrate that abdominal CT is the preferred method of examination for such perforations, and endoscopic management is appropriate as a first-line treatment approach.">

Tumor microenvironment components as immune cells contribute to the tumor progression; thereby, the modulation of immune cells to a pro-inflammatory and antitumoral profile could potentialize the immunotherapy, a suggested approach for high-risk patients. Preview studies showed the antitumoral potential of BJcuL, a C- type lectin isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom. It was able to induce immunomodulatory responses, promoting the rolling and adhesion of leukocytes and the activation of neutrophils. Methods:SK-N-SH cells were incubated with conditioned media (CM) obtained during the treatment of neutrophils with BJcuL and fMLP, a bacteria-derived peptide highly effective for activating neutrophil functions. Then we evaluated the effect of the same stimulation on the co-cultivation of neutrophils and SK-N-SH cells. Tumor cells were tested for viability, migration, and invasion potential. Results:In the viability assay, only neutrophils treated with BJcuL (24 h) and cultivated with SK-N-SH were cytotoxic. Migration of tumor cells decreased when incubated directly (p &lt; 0.001) or indirectly (p &lt; 0.005) with untreated neutrophils. When invasion potential was evaluated, neutrophils incubated with BJcuL reduced the total number of colonies of SK-N-SH cells following co-cultivation for 24 h (p &lt; 0.005). Treatment with CM resulted in decreased anchorage-free survival following 24 h of treatment (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion:Data demonstrated that SK-N-SH cells maintain their migratory potential in the face of neutrophil modulation by BJcuL, but their invasive capacity was significantly reduced.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Glioma is one of the important diseases that threaten human survival in today's society. WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) belongs to the components of the lysine methyltransferase complex. WDR5 is involved in gene transcription regulation, cell senescence, cancer and other biological events through methylation modification. However, its expression and function in glioma are still unclear. Materials and Methods:The expression of WDR5 was observed in glioma cells, and then a glioma cell line SW1783 knocked down WDR5 was established. The effects of the decrease of WDR5 expression on proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT of glioma cells were detected, respectively. The downstream regulators of WDR5 were identified by gene expression profiling technology, and the possible molecular mechanisms were identified. Results:In this study, we found that WDR5 could promote glioma cell's proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor metastasis. In glioma, especially in metastatic glioma tissues, WDR5 levels were significantly increased, the higher expression level could also cause a significant reduction in overall survival of glioma patients. Second, the ability of cells' proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor metastasis was significantly reduced in WDR5 knockdown cell lines. We also found a significant change in the expression level of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in WDR5 knockdown cell lines. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of WDR5 could inhibit the expression of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), and knockdown of ZEB1 could inhibit invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in WDR5 over-expression cell line. We also found that WDR5 may regulate ZEB1's expression through H3K4me3. Conclusion:In summary, in this study, we have studied the relationship between WDR5 and glioma, and found that WDR5's expression is positively correlated with the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells, which will help find the potential therapeutic target for glioma patients.">

The present study aims to investigate the effects of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-targeted and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) agonist (GW0742)-loaded NMs on apoptosis and migration in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-induced human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMCs). METHODS:The GW0742-loaded NMs (M-GW) and VCAM-1-targeted NMs loaded with GW0742 (TM-GW) were prepared, and then the morphologies and the size distribution of M-GM and TM-GM were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS), respectively. In vitro drug release assay of M-GM and TM-GM were performed as well. Next, HAVSMCs were cultured in medium containing ox-LDL to mimic atherosclerotic environment, and the effects of free GW0742, M-GM and TM-GM on endocytosis, cell migration and apoptosis, as well as the expression of VCAM-1, and proteins associated with migration and apoptosis were measured in HAVSMCs treated with ox-LDL. RESULTS:M-GM and TM-GM were successfully prepared. VCAM-1 was overexpressed in HAVSMCs treated with ox-LDL, and TM-GM had a strong targeting ability to HAVSMCs treated with ox-LDL compared with M-GM. In addition, compared with free GW0742, both M-GM and TM-GM significantly diminished cell apoptosis and migration in HAVSMCs treated with ox-LDL. CONCLUSIONS:TM-GM had a superior suppressing effect on apoptosis and migration of ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs.">

        <span class="abst" title="The edge-based computing paradigm (ECP) becomes one of the most innovative modes of processing distributed Interneit of Things (IoT) sensor data. However, the edge nodes in ECP are usually resource-constrained. When more services are executed on an edge node, the resources required by these services may exceed the edge node's, so as to fail to maintain the normal running of the edge node. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a resource-constrained smart service migration framework for edge computing environment in IoT (IoT-RECSM) and a dynamic edge service migration algorithm. Based on this algorithm, the framework can dynamically migrate services of resource-critical edge nodes to resource-rich nodes. In the framework, four abstract models are presented to quantificationally evaluate the resource usage of edge nodes and the resource consumption of edge service in real-time. Finally, an edge smart services migration prototype system is implemented to simulate the edge service migration in IoT environment. Based on the system, an IoT case including 10 edge nodes is simulated to evaluate the proposed approach. According to the experiment results, service migration among edge nodes not only maintains the stability of service execution on edge nodes, but also reduces the sensor data traffic between edge nodes and cloud center.">

The migration through a limited number of paths through tissues and capillary networks seems efficient and 'traffic jams' are generally avoided. However, the mechanisms that guide efficient trafficking of large numbers of neutrophils through capillary networks are not well understood. Here we show that pairs of neutrophils arriving closely one after another at capillary bifurcations migrate to alternating branches in vivo and in vitro. Perturbation of chemoattractant gradients and the increased hydraulic resistance induced by the first neutrophil in one branch biases the migration of the following neutrophil towards the other branch. These mechanisms guide neutrophils to efficiently navigate through capillary networks and outline the effect of inter-neutrophil interactions during migration on overall lymphocyte trafficking patterns in confined environments.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Synovial tissue fibrosis is common in advanced OA with features including the presence of stress fiber-positive myofibroblasts and deposition of cross-linked collagen type-I. Proteoglycan-4 (PRG4) is a mucinous glycoprotein secreted by synovial fibroblasts and is a major component of synovial fluid. PRG4 is a ligand of the CD44 receptor. Our objective was to examine the role of PRG4-CD44 interaction in regulating synovial tissue fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. METHODS:OA synoviocytes were treated with TGF-β ± PRG4 for 24 h and α-SMA content was determined using immunofluorescence. Rhodamine-labeled rhPRG4 was incubated with OA synoviocytes ± anti-CD44 or isotype control antibodies and cellular uptake of rhPRG4 was determined following a 30-min incubation and α-SMA expression following a 24-h incubation. HEK-TGF-β cells were treated with TGF-β ± rhPRG4 and Smad3 phosphorylation was determined using immunofluorescence and TGF-β/Smad pathway activation was determined colorimetrically. We probed for stress fibers and focal adhesions (FAs) in TGF-β-treated murine fibroblasts and fibroblast migration was quantified ± rhPRG4. Synovial expression of fibrotic markers: α-SMA, collagen type-I, and PLOD2 in Prg4 gene-trap (Prg4GT) and recombined Prg4GTR animals were studied at 2 and 9 months of age. Synovial expression of α-SMA and PLOD2 was determined in 2-month-old Prg4GT/GT&amp;Cd44-/- and Prg4GTR/GTR&amp;Cd44-/- animals. RESULTS:PRG4 reduced α-SMA content in OA synoviocytes (p &lt; 0.001). rhPRG4 was internalized by OA synoviocytes via CD44 and CD44 neutralization attenuated rhPRG4's antifibrotic effect (p &lt; 0.05). rhPRG4 reduced pSmad3 signal in HEK-TGF-β cells (p &lt; 0.001) and TGF-β/Smad pathway activation (p &lt; 0.001). rhPRG4 reduced the number of stress fiber-positive myofibroblasts, FAs mean size, and cell migration in TGF-β-treated NIH3T3 fibroblasts (p &lt; 0.05). rhPRG4 inhibited fibroblast migration in a macrophage and fibroblast co-culture model without altering active or total TGF-β levels. Synovial tissues of 9-month-old Prg4GT/GT animals had higher α-SMA, collagen type-I, and PLOD2 (p &lt; 0.001) content and Prg4 re-expression reduced these markers (p &lt; 0.01). Prg4 re-expression also reduced α-SMA and PLOD2 staining in CD44-deficient mice. CONCLUSION:PRG4 is an endogenous antifibrotic modulator in the joint and its effect on myofibroblast formation is partially mediated by CD44, but CD44 is not required to demonstrate an antifibrotic effect in vivo.">

Nevertheless, the roles of circKIF4A in breast cancer (BC) are still not very clear. METHODS:Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was conducted to determine the expression of circKIF4A, miR-152, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) mRNA and caspase-3. Western blot assay was utilized to examine the protein level of ZEB1. Transwell assay and flow-cytometric analysis were adopted for the evaluation of cell migration, invasion and apoptosis, respectively. The associations among circKIF4A, miR-152 and ZEB1 were predicted by online websites and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. RESULTS:CircKIF4A and ZEB1 were conspicuously upregulated and miR-152 was markedly reduced in BC tissues and cells. Deficiency of circKIF4A repressed migration, invasion and induced apoptosis of BC cells. Moreover, circKIF4A was confirmed to be a sponge of miR-152 and miR-152 could bind to ZEB1. MiR-152 inhibition or ZEB1 overexpression abolished the impacts of circKIF4A knockdown on cell migration, invasion and apoptosis in BC. CONCLUSION:Silencing of circKIF4A hampered cell metastasis and promoted apoptosis by regulating ZEB1 via sponging miR-152 in BC.">

        <span class="abst" title="Differential migration-increased migration propensity with increasing individual size-is common in migratory species. Like other forms of partial migration, it provides spatial buffering against regional differences in habitat quality and sources of mortality. We investigated differential migration and its consequences to survival and reproductive patterns in striped bass, a species with well-known plasticity in migration behaviors. A size-stratified sample of Potomac River (Chesapeake Bay) Morone saxatilis striped bass was implanted with acoustic transmitters and their subsequent coastal shelf migrations recorded over a 4-yr period by telemetry receivers throughout the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Southern New England. A generalized linear mixed model predicted that ≥ 50% of both males and females depart the Chesapeake Bay at large sizes &gt;80 cm total length. Egressing striped bass exited through both the Chesapeake Bay mouth and Delaware Bay (via the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal), favoring the former. All large fish migrated to Massachusetts shelf waters and in subsequent years repeatedly returned to regions within Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays. Within this dominant behavior, minority behaviors included straying, skipped spawning, and residency by large individuals (those expected to migrate). Analysis of the last day of transmission indicated that small resident striped bass experienced nearly 2-fold higher loss rates (70% yr-1) than coastal shelf emigrants (37% yr-1). The study confirmed expectations for a threshold size at emigration and different mortality levels between Chesapeake Bay (resident) and ocean (migratory) population contingents; and supported the central premise of the current assessment and management framework of a two-contingent population: smaller Chesapeake Bay residents and a larger ocean contingent. An improved understanding of differential migration thus affords an opportunity to specify stock assessments according to different population sub-components, and tailor reference points and control rules between regions and fishing stakeholder groups.">

This highly complex process characterizes the developing brain of the fetus, the early postnatal brain, and the adult brain, as reflected by changes within the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where neurogenesis persists throughout life. Psychosis also appears to be linked to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. However, little is known about the connection between psychosis, HCMV infection, and disruption of neuronal migration. The present study addresses the hypothesis that HCMV infection may lead to mental disorders through mechanisms of autoimmune cross-reactivity. Searching for common peptides that underlie immune cross-reactions, the analyses focus on HCMV and human proteins involved in neuronal migration. Results demonstrate a large overlap of viral peptides with human proteins associated with neuronal migration, such as ventral anterior homeobox 1 and cell adhesion molecule 1 implicated in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. The present findings support the possibility of immune cross-reactivity between HCMV and human proteins that-when altered, mutated, or improperly functioning-may disrupt normal neuronal migration. In addition, these findings are consistent with a molecular and mechanistic framework for pathological sequences of events, beginning with HCMV infection, followed by immune activation, cross-reactivity, and neuronal protein variations that may ultimately contribute to the emergence of mental disorders, including psychosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of red Light Emiting Diode (red LED) irradiation on fibroblasts in adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) co-culture on the scratch assay. We hypothesized that red LED irradiation could stimulate paracrine secretion of ASC, contributing to the activation of genes and molecules involved in cell migration and tissue repair. ASC were co-cultured with NIH/3T3 fibroblasts through direct contact and subjected to red LED irradiation (1.45 J/cm2/5min6s) after the scratch assay, during 4 days. Four groups were established: fibroblasts (F), fibroblasts + LED (FL), fibroblasts + ASC (FC) and fibroblasts + LED + ASC (FLC). The analyzes were based on Ctgf and Reck expression, quantification of collagen types I and III, tenomodulin, VEGF, TGF-β1, MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as viability analysis and cell migration. Higher Ctgf expression was observed in FC compared to F. Group FC presented higher amount of tenomodulin and VEGF in relation to the other groups. In the cell migration analysis, a higher number of cells was observed in the scratched area of the FC group on the 4th day. There were no differences between groups considering cell viability, Reck expression, amount of collagen types I and III, MMP-2 and TGF-β1, whereas TGF-β1 was not detected in the FC group and the MMP-9 in none of the groups. Our hypothesis was not supported by the results because the red LED irradiation decreased the healing response of ASC. An inhibitory effect of the LED irradiation associated with ASC co-culture was observed with reduction of the amount of TGF-β1, VEGF and tenomodulin, possibly involved in the reduced cell migration. In turn, the ASC alone seem to have modulated fibroblast behavior by increasing Ctgf, VEGF and tenomodulin, leading to greater cell migration. In conclusion, red LED and ASC therapy can have independent effects on fibroblast wound healing, but the combination of both does not have a synergistic effect. Therefore, future studies with other parameters of red LED associated with ASC should be tested aiming clinical application for tissue repair.">

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4 (NOX4) induces ROS generation and, consequently, enhances cell migration. Despite the important interrelationship between RA, FLS, and ROS, the effect of NOX4 on RA pathogenesis remains unclear. METHODS:FLS isolated from RA (n = 5) and osteoarthritis (OA, n = 5) patients were stimulated with recombinant interleukin 17 (IL-17; 10 ng/ml) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α; 10 ng/ml) for 1 h. Cell migration, invasion, adhesion molecule expression, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, and ROS expression were examined. The mRNA and protein levels of NOX4 were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively. The NOX4 inhibitor GLX351322 and NOX4 siRNA were used to inhibit NOX4 to probe the effect of NOX4 on these cellular processes. RESULTS:Migration of RA FLS was increased 2.48-fold after stimulation with IL-17 and TNF-α, while no difference was observed for OA FLS. ROS expression increased in parallel with invasiveness of FLS following cytokine stimulation. When the expression of NOX was examined, NOX4 was significantly increased by 9.73-fold in RA FLS compared to unstimulated FLS. Following NOX4 inhibition, cytokine-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1), VEGF, and migration and invasion capacity of RA FLS were markedly decreased to unstimulated levels. CONCLUSION:NOX4 is a key contributor to cytokine-enhanced migration and invasion via modulation of ROS, VCAM1, and VEGF in RA FLS.">

Cell proliferation, transwell, and wound healing assays were performed. The impact of EEA on tumor growth was investigated using a xenograft model. Expressions of migration-related proteins (MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2) and apoptosis-related proteins (cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP) were determined using western blot analysis. The results indicated that EEA significantly inhibited the capacities of proliferation, invasion, and migration of HNSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved PARP expressions were increased in cells treated with an increasing concentration of EEA, which suggested that EEA induced apoptosis of HNSCC. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were downregulated when cells were administered EEA, while TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were not affected, which uncovered the mechanisms mediating the EEA-induced inhibition on cell invasion and migration. The animal experiment also suggested that EEA inhibited tumor growth. Our study confirmed the inhibitive effects of EEA on cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of HNSCC in vitro and in vivo, providing the basis for further study of the application of EEA as an effective candidate for cancer treatment.">

Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2), a noncanonical Wnt receptor, plays crucial roles in skeletal morphogenesis, osteoblast differentiation, and bone formation. The role of ROR2 in PCa metastasis is unclear. We analyzed online datasets from Oncomine as well as using IHC staining on tissue array to determine the relationship between ROR2 expression level and disease outcome of PCa. To investigate how ROR2 regulates migration and invasion of PCa cells, we performed transwell assay and orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice. We then applied the Micro-Western Array (MWA), a high-throughput western blotting platform to analyze the downstream signaling pathways being regulated by ROR2. Compared with nonmalignant PZ-HPV-7 and RWPE-1 cells, PCa cell lines express lower level of ROR2 protein. Constitutive expression of ROR2 in PC-3, DU-145, or C4-2B PCa cells significantly suppressed the cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) proteins. MWA, western blotting, and microRNA analysis showed that elevation of ROR2 suppressed the expression of miR-199a-5p, which in turn increased the expression of PIAS3. The upregulation of PIAS3 then decreased AKT2 and the phosphorylation of AKT, resulting in the inhibition of migration and invasion of PCa cells both in vitro and in orthotopic xenograft mice model. IHC staining of tissue array and Oncomine datasets analysis indicated that the gene and protein level of ROR2 is much lower in metastatic prostate tumors as compared with primary tumors or adjacent normal prostate tissues. Low level of ROR2 correlated to poor survival and high recurrent frequency in PCa patients. In conclusion, we discovered that ROR2 suppresses PCa metastasis via regulation of PIAS3-PI3K-AKT2 signaling axis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Objective:Tenacissoside H (TDH) is a Chinese medicine monomer extracted from Marsdenia tenacissima extract (MTE), which has been confirmed to have antitumor effects, but its mechanism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of TDH on human colon cancer LoVo cell proliferation and migration and explore the correlation of TDH treatment with the expression of GOLPH3 and cell signaling pathways in LoVo cells. Methods:LoVo cells were treated with TDH at 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μg/mL for 24, 48, and 72 h. The proliferation rate of LoVo cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Recombinant plasmid p-CMV-2-GOLPH3 was constructed, and p-CMV-2-GOLPH3 and p-CMV-2 empty plasmids were transfected into LoVo cells by lipofection. Western blotting was used to detect the transfection efficiency and the expression of p-p70S6K, p70S6K, β-catenin, and GOLPH3. The apoptosis rate was analyzed with Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining method, and cell migration assessed by transwell assay. Results:TDH inhibited the proliferation of LoVo cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 of TDH treatment in LoVo cells at 24, 48, and 72 h was 40.24, 13.00, and 5.73 μg/mL, respectively. TDH treatment significantly induced apoptosis and suppressed the viability and migration of human colon cancer LoVo cells. The effect of TDH on induction of apoptosis and inhibition of migration in LoVo cells decreased significantly after activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways with agonists. Additionally, the expression of GOLPH3 protein downregulated significantly in LoVo cells under TDH treatment. Overexpression of the GOLPH3 gene increased the expression of key proteins in PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and blocked the antitumor activity of TDH. Conclusion:Collectively, the present results indicated that TDH can inhibit the proliferation vitality of colon cancer LoVo cells through downregulating GOLPH3 expression and activity of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways.">

Kaplan-Meier curve was used to determine survival rate. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to evaluate the interactions among LINC00173, miR-765 and PLP2 (proteolipid protein 2). CCK8 assay, EdU assay, transwell assay and xenograft assay were performed to examine the effect of LINC00173/miR-765/PLP2 axis on proliferation, migration and invasion. The Ki67 expression level in tumors tissues was detected through immunofluorescence assay. Results:LINC00173 expression was markedly upregulated in CRC tissues and cells. High expression level of LINC00173 in CRC patients was correlated with poor prognosis. LINC00173 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and chemo-resistance of CRC cells in vitro. LINC00173 downregulation delayed CRC growth in vivo. LINC00173 interacted with miR-765 to promote PLP2 expression. Conclusion:Our results demonstrated that LINC00173 plays an important oncogenic role in CRC via modulating miR-765/PLP2 axis.

Recently, BTK inhibitors have also become promising novel treatment reagents for prostate cancer. The current study was designed to investigate expression of BTK in prostate cancer tissues in comparison with benign hyperplasia and effect of BTK inhibitor on prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Methods:BTK expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry; migration and invasion prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3) were assessed by Transwell migration and wound﻿-healing assay; cancer cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay kit; expression of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and ﻿-9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) was assessed by immunoblotting. Results:Strong expression of BTK was detected in the prostate cancer tissues, especially in the tumors from prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis. BTK inhibitor (Ibrutinib) significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells as well as protein synthesis of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by the tumor cells. Overexpressing BTK could partially but significantly block the inhibitory effect of Ibrutinib on cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and protein synthesis of MMP-2 and MMP-9 of the cancer cells. Conclusion:These findings suggested that BTK could serve as not only a biomarker but also a therapeutic target for the prostate cancer and that Ibrutinib may be applied as a therapeutic drug for the prostate cancer.">

Methods:The expression of miR-766 and programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) was detected in CSCC tissues and CSCC cell lines (A431, SCL-1 and DJM-1 cells) by qRT-RCR. The proliferation, colony-forming ability, apoptosis, migration and invasion of A431 and SCL-1 cells was measured by MTT, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound healing and transwell assay, respectively. The interaction between miR-766 and PDCD5 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and PDCD5 was measured by Western blot. In addition, A431 cells were subcutaneously injected into mice, and the tumor volume and weight were measured. Results:MiR-766 was upregulated, and PDCD5 was downregulated in CSCC tissues and cells. MiR-766 significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion, and inhibited the apoptosis of A431 and SCL-1 cells. MiR-766 also significantly increased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in A431 and SCL-1 cells. PDCD5 was a target gene of miR-766. PDCD5 significantly reversed the tumor-promoting effect of miR-766 on A431 and SCL-1 cells. In addition, miR-766 inhibitor inhibited the tumor growth in mice. Conclusion:MiR-766 inhibitor inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted the apoptosis of CSCC cells via downregulating PDCD5.">

We sought to characterize the interactions between infectious agent burden, fish immune and stress physiology and fisheries stressors to investigate the potential for capture-mediated pathogen-induced mortality in adult coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch. We used radio-telemetry paired with high-throughput qPCR of non-lethal gill biopsies for infectious agents and host biomarkers from 200 tagged fish experimentally displaced and exposed to various experimental fisheries treatments (gill net entanglement, recreational angling and recreational angling with air exposure vs. non-sampled control). We characterized relationships among post-release behaviour and survival, infectious agent presence and loads, physiological parameters and transcription profiles of stress and immune genes. All infectious agents detected were endemic and in loads consistent with previous adult Pacific salmon monitoring. Individuals exposed to fisheries treatments were less likely to reach spawning habitat compared to controls, and handling duration independent of fisheries gear had a negative effect on survival. High infectious agent burden was associated with accelerated migration initiation post-release, revealing behavioural plasticity in response to deteriorating condition in this semelparous species. Prevalence and load of infectious agents increased post-migration as well as transcription signatures reflected changes in immune and stress profiles consistent with senescence. Results from this study further our understanding of factors associated with fisheries that increase risk of post-release mortality and characterize some physiological mechanisms that underpin migratory behaviour.">

However, the origin and nature of these abnormalities remain unresolved and no study examined unaffected individuals (UIs) with multiple relatives with schizophrenia.MethodsThree patients diagnosed as schizophrenia (SZs), 3 UIs who has multiple relatives diagnosed as schizophrenia including at least one first-degree relative, and 3 healthy controls (HCs), all males, were recruited from Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH), Korea. iNSCs were generated from human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) using small molecule-based lineage switch technique. The NSC marker expressions in iNSCs were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The migration of iNSCs was analysed by CytoSelect 96-well cell migration assay.ResultsDemographic characteristics were not significantly different among the groups. Level of functioning was significantly lower in SZs. Either mRNA levels of NSC markers or NCAM protein levels were not significantly different among the groups. Doubling time among the groups were not significantly different. Migration capability of iNSCs from not only SZs, but also UIs were significantly smaller than HCs.DiscussionWe report a novel finding of defective ability of the iNSCs of UIs to reach the target along with those of SZs which is the first explicit demonstration of the postulation that neurodevelopmental abnormality might be present in UIs, using iNSCs directly derived from living subjects.">

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractBackgroundAlthough there is a large evidence base suggesting elevated rates of psychotic disorder for some migrant groups, relative to the non-migrant host population, less is known about factors that modify the risk of psychosis within migrant groups. Our objective was to assess whether pre-migration, migration-related, and post-migration factors were associated with an elevated risk of psychotic disorder among first-generation migrants in Ontario, Canada.MethodsUsing linked population-based health administrative data, we constructed a retrospective cohort of first-generation migrants to Ontario over a 20-year period between 1992 and 2012. We identified first onset non-affective psychotic disorders using a validated algorithm. Pre-migration factors included sex, country of origin, education, occupation, marital status, and language. Migration-related factors included age at migration, year of migration, duration of residence, and migrant class. Post-migration factors included rural place of residence and neighbourhood-level indicators of marginalization. We used Poisson regression models to compute incidence rate ratios for each pre-migration, migration-related, and post-migration factor to assess its magnitude of effect on the risk of developing psychosis, relative to migrants who did not develop psychotic disorder.ResultsOur cohort included over two million first-generation migrants over the 20-year period. Preliminary findings suggest that males, refugees, and people who set up residence in urban centres have higher rates of psychotic disorder, and people who are older at the time of migration and those who set up residence in high-income areas have lower rates of psychotic disorder. Full results for pre-migration, migration-related, and post-migration risk factors will be presented.DiscussionMigrant status is one of few well-established risk factors for psychotic disorder, yet we have limited understanding of the underlying etiology. The findings from this study help to identify high-risk groups to target for intervention. Improving our understanding of key risk factors for psychotic disorders within migrant groups is crucial for informing prevention and early intervention efforts.">

        <span class="abst" title="MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating the development and metastasis of human cancers. MiR-221 is reported to be an oncogene in multiple cancers, including bladder cancer (BC). Deregulation of autophagy is associated with multiple human malignant cancers. Whether and how miR-221 regulates autophagy and how miR-221 has been regulated in BC are poorly understood. This study explored the potential functions and mechanisms of miR-221 in the autophagy and tumorigenesis of BC. We showed that the downregulation of miR-221 induces autophagy via increasing TP53INP1 (tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 1) and inhibits migration and invasion of BC cells through suppressing activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Furthermore, the expression of miR-221 is regulated by high-mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) which is overexpressed in BC. And both miR-221 and HMGA1 are correlated with poor patient survival in BC. Finally, the downregulation of HMGA1 suppressed the proliferative, migrative, and invasive property of BC by inducing toxic autophagy via miR-221/TP53INP1/p-ERK axis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the downregulation of miR-221 and HMGA1 mediates autophagy in BC, and both of them are valuable therapeutic targets for BC.">

However, the patterns and underlying drivers of variation in dispersal across species remain unclear, partly because standardised estimates of dispersal ability are rarely available. Here we present a global dataset of avian hand-wing index (HWI), an estimate of wing shape widely adopted as a proxy for dispersal ability in birds. We show that HWI is correlated with geography and ecology across 10,338 (&gt;99%) species, increasing at higher latitudes and with migration, and decreasing with territoriality. After controlling for these effects, the strongest predictor of HWI is temperature variability (seasonality), with secondary effects of diet and habitat type. Finally, we also show that HWI is a strong predictor of geographical range size. Our analyses reveal a prominent latitudinal gradient in HWI shaped by a combination of environmental and behavioural factors, and also provide a global index of avian dispersal ability for use in community ecology, macroecology, and macroevolution.">

Experiments have shown that at the onset of migration, the motility is self-generated as a polarisation wave starting from the leading edge of the monolayer and progressively propagates into the bulk. However, it is unclear how the propagation of this motility wave is influenced by cellular properties. Here, we investigate this question using a computational model based on the Potts model coupled to the dynamics of intracellular polarisation. The model captures the propagation of the polarisation wave and suggests that the cells cortex can regulate the migration modes: strongly contractile cells may depolarise the monolayer, whereas less contractile cells can form swirling movement. Cortical contractility is further found to limit the cells motility, which (i) decelerates the wave speed and the leading edge progression, and (ii) destabilises the leading edge. Together, our model describes how different mechanical properties of cells can contribute to the regulation of collective cell migration.">

The purpose is to cover the on-lay mesh placed in &quot;U&quot; fashion to reinforce the crus suture. RESULTS:We have performed laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair in 173 patients (total group). Early postoperative complications were observed in 35 patients (27.1%) and one patient died (0.7%) due to a massive lung thromboembolism. One hundred twenty-nine patients were followed-up for a mean of 41+28months. Mesh placement was performed in 79 of these patients. The remnant sac was rotated behind the esophagus in order to cover the mesh surface. In this group, late complications were observed in five patients (2.9%). We have not observed mesh erosion or migration to the esophagogastric lumen. CONCLUSION:The proposed technique should be useful for preventing erosion and migration into the esophagus.">

However, the correlation between PTBP3 expression and pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains little known. The design of the study attempts to examine the role of PTBP3 in the pathogenesis and prognosis of NSCLC. Methods:Our study conducted an investigation on the PTBP3 expression in human NSCLC tissues and a comprehensive analysis of the associations between three factors, involving the PTBP3 expression, clinicopathological features, and patient's survival. Additionally, we also explored the role of PTBP3 expression in the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. Results:The mining of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, western blotting and immunohistochemistry analyses showed significantly up-regulation of PTBP3 in NSCLC tissues than in normal tissues. Although overexpress or knockdown PTBP3 expression had no significant effect on proliferation of selected cell line, it could promotes migration of NSCLC cells via regulating E-cadherin in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling pathway. Moreover, in the univariate analysis, the PTBP3-high is markedly related to poor overall survival results where hazard ratio (HR): 1.55; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.87-2.01; p = 0.0001. Also, according to the multivariate analysis, an independent prognostic factor among NSCLC patients is the PTBP3 with an HR of 1.42 (CI: 1.09-1.9; p = 0.011). To explore potential signaling pathways, we used the TCGA dataset and performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Moreover, its expression in NSCLC was related to Tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis status and poor prognosis. Beside, by changing the expression of PTBP3 in selected cell lines, we found that overexpress or knockdown PTBP3 expression had no significant effect on proliferation, however it regulated migration possibly by EMT signaling. Conclusions:Collectively, our findings suggested that PTBP3 contributed to the progression of NSCLC and might serve as a potential target for anti-cancer therapy.">

In particular, certain suburbs may attract residents due to lower commute costs, and this is believed to lead to compactification of a city, with highly populated central business district and sprawled suburbia. In this paper we assess residential resettlement patterns in Australian capital cities by analyzing the 2011 and 2016 Australian Census data. Rather than explicitly defining a residential attractiveness of each suburb in subjective terms, we introduce and calibrate a model which quantifies the intra-city migration flows in terms of the attractiveness potentials (and their differences), inferring these from the data. We discover that, despite the existence of well-known static agglomeration patterns favouring central districts over the suburbia, the dynamic flows that shape the intra-city migration over the last decade reveal the preference directed away from the central districts with a high density of jobs and population, towards the less populated suburbs on the periphery. Furthermore, we discover that the relocation distance of such resettlement flows plays a vital role, and explains a significant part of the variation in migration flows: the resettlement flow markedly decreases with the relocation distance. Finally, we propose a conjecture that these directional resettlement flows are explained by the cities' structure, with monocentric cities exhibiting outward flows with much higher reluctance to long-distance relocation. This conjecture is verified across the major Australian capitals: both monocentric (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart) and polycentric (Darwin and Canberra).">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Periodontitis is a chronic inflammation of the tooth supporting structures that finally can lead to tooth loss. As chronic periodontitis is associated with systemic diseases multiple approaches have been followed to support regeneration of the destructed tissue. But very few materials are actually used in the clinic. A new and promising group of biomaterials with advantageous biomechanical properties that have the ability to support periodontal regeneration are self-assembling peptides (SAP). However, there is still a lack of 3D periodontal models that can evaluate the migration potential of such novel materials. METHODS:All experiments were performed with primary human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLF). Migration capacity was assessed in a three-dimensional model of the human periodontal ligament by measuring the migration distance of viable cells on coated (Enamel Matrix Protein (EMP), P11-4, collagen I) or uncoated human dentin. Cellular metabolic activity on P11-4 hydrogels was assessed by a metabolic activity assay. Deposition of ECM molecules in a P11-4 hydrogel was visualized by immunostaining of collagen I and III and fibrillin I. RESULTS:The 3D periodontal model was feasible to show the positive effect of EMP for periodontal regeneration. Subsequently, self-assembling peptide P11-4 was used to evaluate its capacity to support regenerative processes in the 3D periodontal model. HPLF coverage of the dentin surface coated with P11-4 increased significantly over time, even though delayed compared to EMP. Cell viability increased and inclusion of ECM proteins into the biomaterial was shown. CONCLUSION:The presented results indicate that the 3D periodontal model is feasible to assess periodontal defect coverage and that P11-4 serves as an efficient supporter of regenerative processes in the periodontal ligament. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:The establishment of building-block synthetic polymers offers new opportunities for clinical application in dentistry. Self-assembling peptides represent a new generation of biomaterials as they are able to respond dynamically to the changing environment of the biological surrounding. Especially in the context of peri-implant disease prevention and treatment they enable the implementation of new concepts.">

However, the role of circPSMC3 in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of circPSMC3 in NSCLC tissues was measured through qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). The effect of circPSMC3 on the invasion and migration of NSCLC cell line H1299 was determined through transwell invasion assay and wound healing assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed for exploring the regulatory interaction between circPSMC3, miR-182-5p, and NME2. RESULTS Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the expression of circPSMC3 in NSCLC tissues was decreased. Lower circPSMC3 expression was closely associated with lymph node metastasis and higher TNM stage in NSCLC patients. Biological function analysis suggested that circPSMC3 inhibits the invasion and migration of H1299 cells through upregulating the expression of NME2. Mechanistically, circPSMC3 sponges miR-182-5p to suppress the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells via upregulating NME2 expression.

        <span class="abst" title="Neuronal migration is essential for constructing functional neural networks. Two posterior septal (PS) nuclei, the triangular septal nucleus and bed nuclei of the anterior commissure, are involved in fear and anxiety. During development, glutamatergic PS neurons undergo long-distance rostrodorsal migration from the thalamic eminence (TE) of the diencephalon, then settle in the caudalmost telencephalon. However, the developmental behavior of PS neurons and the guidance structures facilitating their migration remain unknown. We previously demonstrated the migration of PS neurons along the fornix, a major efferent pathway from the hippocampal formation. Here, we show that the postcommissural fornix is essential for PS neuron migration which is largely confined to its axonal tract, which grows in the opposite direction as PS neuron migration. Fornical axons reach the TE prior to initiation of PS neuron rostrodorsal migration. Ectopic expression of Semaphorin 3 A in the dorsomedial cortex resulted in defective fornix formation. Furthermore, loss of the postcommissural fornix stalled PS neuron migration resulting in abnormal accumulation near their origin. This suggests that PS neurons utilize the postcommissural fornix as a permissive corridor during migration beyond the diencephalic-telencephalic boundary. This axonal support is essential for the functional organization of the heterogeneous septal nuclear complex.">

The aim of this study was to investigate how self-reported adolescent physical and mental health are associated with parental migration. Methods:Based on cross-sectional data of 13996 students in 112 schools drawn from a nationally representative sample of middle school students in China, this study used self-reported measures for adolescent physical and mental health. Ordered logistic regression was used for the analysis of self-reported physical health, and linear regression was used for the analysis of self-reported mental health, both adjusting for socio-economic covariates and school fixed effects, to determine how adolescent health is associated with parental migration. Findings:In urban areas, migrant adolescents were physically healthier (OR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.03-1.36), and similarly mentally healthy (b=-0.07, 95% CI: -0.37-0.23), compared to urban adolescents from intact families; in rural areas, left-behind adolescents were less physically (OR=0.84, 95% CI: 0.76-0.94) and mentally (b=0.45, 95% CI: 0.24-0.66) healthy than rural-intact adolescents, holding other variables constant. Left-behind adolescents had less close parent-adolescent relationships than rural-intact adolescents with both father (OR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.56-0.71) and mother (OR=0.62, 95% CI: 0.54-0.70). Interpretation:Our study highlights a great need for health interventions aimed at left-behind adolescents in China and globally, and the important roles of parent-adolescent relationships in addressing the health needs of left-behind adolescents.">

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, and just a few studies have examined the effects of SMF on metastasis, an important concern in cancer treatment. In this study, we evaluated the effects of moderate SMF (~150 mT) on the proliferation and migration of 4T1 breast cancer cells. Our results showed that SMF treatment accelerated cell proliferation but inhibited cell migration. Further, SMF treatment shortened the telomere length, decreased telomerase activity, and inhibited the expression of the cancer-specific marker telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which may be related to expression upregulation of e2f1, a transcription repressor of TERT and positive regulator of the mitotic cell cycle. Our results revealed that SMF repressed both, cell migration and telomerase function. The telomerase network is responsive to SMF and may be involved in SMF-mediated cancer-specific effects; moreover, it may function as a therapeutic target in magnetic therapy of cancers.">

Our objective was to explore the role of NLRC5 in the progression of endometrial cancer (EC). METHODS:The roles of NLRC5 in migration and invasion of AN3CA EC cells were examined by cell wound-healing assay, Transwell migration, and invasion analysis. Overexpression of NLRC5 was achieved with NLRC5 plasmid, and knockdown of NLRC5 was achieved using small interfering (si)RNA-NLRC5 in AN3CA cells. The expression of NLRC5 was detected by immunohistochemical, western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR. LY294002 was used to inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway. RESULTS:NLRC5 was downregulated in EC tissue compared with normal endometrium. Overexpression of NLRC5 led to upregulation of cell migration and invasion in AN3CA cells and expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-9. Inhibition of NLRC5 restricted migration and invasion of AN3CA cells and expression of MMP9. Overexpression of NLRC5 promoted the activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Inhibiting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway by using LY294002 blocked the positive role of NLRC5 in migration and invasion of AN3CA cells and expression of MMP9. CONCLUSIONS:These results demonstrate that NLRC5 promotes EC progression by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.">

This protective function of NRF2 is the primary cause for therapy resistance in cancer as anti-cancer agents such as BRAF inhibitors also induce NRF2-dependent antioxidative response. We had reported that type I interferons produced upon activation of STING, abrogates NRF2 function. Therefore, we investigated if STING agonists such as the newly developed dimeric aminobenzimidazole (diABZI) could sensitize melanoma cells to the clinically used BRAF inhibitors. Our results reveal that pharmacological activation of STING by diABZI, down regulates NRF2-dependent anti-oxidative responses and potentiates cell-death in melanoma cells when used in combination with BRAF inhibitors.">

Yet, its character in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. The expression of HJURP was assessed in PDAC tissues by RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. HJURP-deficient or overexpressed PDAC cell lines were constructed, using shRNA or plasmids with HJURP insert. MTT, sphere formation assay, migration, and invasion assays were performed to evaluate the viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells. We used xenograft mice models to assess the tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. RNA-seq was applicated in search of the potential downstream target of HJURP in PDAC and subsequent verification were fulfilled via multiple assays, including immunofluorescence. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay were conducted to explore the potential regulation of MDM2 expression by HJURP through H3K4me2. In this current research, we found that the expression of HJURP in PDAC cells and tissue was significantly higher than those of adjacent normal tissue, and high HJURP expression predicted poor survival. HJURP significantly promoted the viability, sphere formation, migration, and invasion of PDAC cells in vitro, HJURP also facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanically, MDM2/p53 axis is critical for HJURP-mediated malignant behaviors in PDAC, and HJURP regulates MDM2 expression through H3K4me2. HJURP could serve as a promising biomarker, and target for PDAC prognosis and treatment.">

We first preliminarily screen candidates and determine the approximate ion-transport paths using empirical both geometric analysis and the bond valence site energy method. A chain of images are then automatically generated along these paths for accurate FP-NEB calculation. In addition, an open web interface is actualized to enable access to the SPSE database, thereby facilitating machine learning.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) refers to the ability of highly invasive tumor cells to link each other to form vessels, which is associated with poor cancer prognosis. However, the antitumor VM agents are still lacking in the clinic. Astragalus Atractylodes mixture (AAM), a traditional Chinese medicine, has shown to inhibit VM formation; however the exact mechanism is not completely clarified. In this study, we found that HCT-116 and LoVo could form a VM network. Additionally, hypoxia increases the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and accelerates migration, VM formation in colorectal cancer cells, while N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) could reverse these phenomena. Notably, further mechanical exploration confirmed that the matrix metalloprotease 2 (MMP2) induction is ROS dependent under hypoxic condition. On the basis, we found that AAM could effectively inhibit hypoxia-induced ROS generation, migration, VM formation as well as HIF-1α and MMP2 expression. In vivo, AAM significantly inhibits metastasis of colorectal cancer in murine lung-metastasis model. Taken together, these results verified that AAM effectively inhibits migration and VM formation by suppressing ROS/HIF-1α/MMP2 pathway in colorectal cancer under hypoxic condition, suggesting AAM could serve as a therapeutic agent to inhibit VM formation in human colorectal cancer.">

In addition, circHIPK3 may also serve as a potential biomarker, to help us know more about the rules of occurrence and development of cancers. In recent studies, many circHIPK3-related cancers have been identified, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, glioma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and chronic myeloid leukemia. This review summarizes recent studies on the biological mechanisms of circHIPK3 and expounds the molecular mechanisms of circHIPK3 in these malignant tumors.">

We report the case of an 81-year-old male who initially presented with symptoms consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed uneventfully. Four months later, the patient presented complaining of a persistent headache despite multiple adjustments in the shunt setting. Shunt series radiographs demonstrated the distal catheter passing through the superior vena cava and looping into the right cardiac atrium and ventricle. Catheter retrieval was attempted from a proximal retroauricular incision but required a combination of snare technique by interventional radiology and, ultimately, surgical venotomy by a cardiothoracic surgeon. The distal catheter was replaced in the abdomen, and the patient had no further complications. This case is the first of its kind reported in the literature that includes a treatment team comprising neurosurgery, interventional radiology, and cardiothoracic surgery.

        <span class="abst" title="Shifts in the timing of animal migration are widespread and well-documented; however, the mechanism underlying these changes is largely unknown. In this study, we test the hypothesis that systematic changes in stopover duration-the time that individuals spend resting and refueling at a site-are driving shifts in songbird migration timing. Specifically, we predicted that increases in stopover duration at our study site could generate increases in passage duration-the number of days that a study site is occupied by a particular species-by changing the temporal breadth of observations and vise versa. We analyzed an uninterrupted 46-year bird banding dataset from Massachusetts, USA using quantile regression, which allowed us to detect changes in early-and late-arriving birds, as well as changes in passage duration. We found that median spring migration had advanced by 1.04 days per decade; that these advances had strengthened over the last 13 years; and that early-and late-arriving birds were advancing in parallel, leading to negligible changes in the duration of spring passage at our site (+0.07 days per decade). In contrast, changes in fall migration were less consistent. Across species, we found that median fall migration had delayed by 0.80 days per decade, and that changes were stronger in late-arriving birds, leading to an average increase in passage duration of 0.45 days per decade. Trends in stopover duration, however, were weak and negative and, as a result, could not explain any changes in passage duration. We discuss, and provide some evidence, that changes in population age-structure, cryptic geographic variation, or shifts in resource availability are consistent with increases in fall passage duration. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of evaluating changes across the entire phenological distribution, rather than just the mean, and stress this as an important consideration for future studies.">

Methods Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting MMP-2/MMP-9 was designed and transfected into WER1-Rb-1 cells. 48 hours after transfection, qRT-PCR and western blot technique were used to investigate the inhibitory effect of MMP-2 and MMP-9 shRNAs. Cell viability was examined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell cycle arrest was detected using a flow cytometer while apoptosis was tested with Annexin V/PI kit. Transwell chamber assay was performed to detect the migration and invasion ability of the WER1-Rb-1 cells. Results After transfection of MMP-2/MMP-9 shRNA, there was a significant decrease in the expressions of both mRNA and protein in the shRNA groups compared with the negative and vector controls. The results of MTT assay suggested that the cell viability was significantly decreased in shRNA groups (p&lt;0.05). Cell apoptosis also increased significantly in shRNA groups compared with the negative and vector controls (p&lt;0.05). The flow cytometer analysis proved that the proportion of the G1 phase increased and the proportion of the G0 phase reduced significantly by the transfection of MMP-2/MMP-9 shRNA (p&lt;0.05). The migration and invasion ability were also significantly decreased in the groups of MMP-2/MMP-9 shRNA (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Cell viability, migration, and invasion ability of RB cells are inhibited, and apoptosis is induced after downregulation of MMP-2/MMP-9 through RNA interference. MMP-2 and MMP-9 may be potential targets in the gene therapy of RB.">

Our aim was to systematically study the migration pattern of tined leads in sacral nerve modulation. Our hypothesis was that tined leads may promote forward migration because of their configuration. METHOD:Consecutive patients treated with sacral nerve modulation with a tined lead electrode, who had experienced loss of efficacy and had radiographs both at baseline and after loss of efficacy between 2005 and 2016 were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS:Twenty-five patients out of 70 with loss of efficacy were studied. Lead migration was measured as percent electrode movement in relation to sacral cortex at lateral projection. All had some degree of lead migration, ranging from 35% backward to 74% forward migration. Sixteen (64%) had forward migration while nine (36%) had backward migration. In seven patients (28%), loss of efficacy was associated with an episode of perceived mechanical strain on the electrode. Fifty percent (4/8) who associated their loss of efficacy with an adverse event had forward migration of the electrode. CONCLUSIONS:Forward lead migration with concomitant loss of efficacy seems to be a common event in patients with tined leads, hence supporting our hypothesis. The retrospective design and that some of the patients with loss of efficacy could not be included because of incomplete data, which is a limitation to the study. Further studies are needed to confirm to what extent the direction and magnitude of the migration relate to loss of efficacy. TRIAL REGISTRATION:">

The interplay between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs plays a crucial role in tumor progression. Methods:In the present study, we performed bioinformatic and biochemical analyses to identify miR-942-5p-interacting lncRNAs. The function and clinical significance of the candidate lncRNA(s) in NSCLC were determined. Results:We identified LIFR-AS1 as a pivotal miR-942-5p-interacting lncRNA. Overexpression of miR-942-5p caused a reduction of LIFR-AS1 in NSCLC cells. LIFR-AS1 showed the ability to sponge miR-942-5p, leading to derepression of ZNF471. Functionally, LIFR-AS1 overexpression inhibited NSCLC cell migration and invasion, whereas LIFR-AS1 silencing yielded an opposite effect. In vivo studies confirmed that LIFR-AS1 overexpression suppressed lung metastasis of NSCLC cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated that enforced expression of miR-942-5p or depletion of ZNF471 restored the migration and invasion capacity of LIFR-AS1-overexpressing cells. Moreover, overexpression of ZNF471 restrained NSCLC cell invasion. Clinically, LIFR-AS1 downregulation was significantly correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and reduced overall survival in NSCLC patients. Conclusions:we provide first evidence for the involvement of the LIFR-AS1/miR-942-5p/ZNF471 axis in NSCLC invasion and metastasis. LIFR-AS1 may represent a novel target for the treatment of NSCLC.">

Here, primary NSCs were cultured and the expression of actin alpha 2 (ACTA2) in NSCs was determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunostaining. Next, the role of ACTA2 in regulating NSC migration and the potential mechanism was explored. Our results demonstrated that ACTA2 expressed in NSCs. Meanwhile, downregulated ACTA2 using siRNA inhibited NSC migration through hindering actin filament polymerization via increasing RhoA expression and decreasing Rac1 expression. The present study might enrich the basic knowledge of ACTA2 in NSC migration and open an avenue for enhancing NSC migration potential, subsequently providing an intervention target for functional recovery after CNS injury.">

The vertical nitrate contaminated range is mainly impacted by annual precipitation, soil properties and groundwater depth, while the horizontal contaminated range is mainly affected by the initial leakage area. During the process, the vertical contaminated range first continuously enlarges, and then decreases after a long time. The nitrate contaminant can exist and affect the environment for as long as 115-625 years, and the nitrate contamination time can be even longer in dry regions. Since nitrate diffuses more quickly in unsaturated regions rather than in saturated regions, the migration region and contaminated range both decrease as the groundwater depth is increased.">

Image analysis of the real time observation of TGFβ-induced keratinocytes revealed a faster wound closure and individual migration velocity compared to the untreated control. TGFβ-induced keratinocytes also have reduced circularity and display a classic EMT protein expression. Treatment of 0.0015% (v/v) KH reverses these effects. In untreated keratinocytes, KH resulted in slower initial wound closure and individual migration velocity, which sped up later on, resulting in greater wound closure at the final time point. KH treatment also led to greater directional migration compared to the control. KH treatment caused reduced circularity in keratinocytes but displayed a partial EMT protein expression. Taken together, the findings suggest the therapeutic potential of KH in preventing keloid scar by attenuating TGFβ-induced EMT.">

Connection of FOXD2-AS1 and mcroRNA-324-3p (miR-324-3p) or miR-324-3p and p53 and DNA damage regulated 1 (PDRG1) was analyzed with bioinformatic analysis method and dual-luciferase activity reporter assay. Results:Here, we found that FOXD2-AS1 was highly expressed in proliferating-phase hemangioma tissues compared with the involuting-phase hemangioma tissues. Functionally, FOXD2-AS1 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Conversely, overexpression of FOXD2-AS1 promoted tumor growth in vitro. Mechanistically, FOXD2-AS1 inversely regulated miR-324-3p abundance in hemangioma cells. We also found FOXD2-AS1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by directly sponging miR-324-3p to regulate PDRG1 expression. In addition, the knockdown of PDRG1 reversed the stimulation effects of FOXD2-AS1 overexpression on HA cells. Conclusion:To conclude, our study sheds novel light on the biological roles of FOXD2-AS1 in hemangioma, which may help the development of targeted therapy method for cancer.">

        <span class="abst" title="The increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are critical in the progression of atherosclerosis (AS). Platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB) may induce VSMC proliferation and migration. miR-142-5p plays a critical role in various biological processes, including tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and inflammation. However, whether miR-142-5p is involved in regulating the pathological process of arteriosclerosis remains to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, the role of miR-142-5p in PDGF-BB-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSAMC) proliferation and migration was investigated. The results revealed that the expression level of miR-142-5p was enhanced in the serum of patients with AS, while that of its target gene, myocardin-like protein 2 (MKL2) was decreased, compared with that in healthy volunteers. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between miR-142-5p and MKL2 expression in the serum of patients with AS. Furthermore, the downregulation of miR-142-5p inhibited PDGF-BB-induced HASMC proliferation and migration; however, the inhibition of HASMC proliferation and migration was reversed by co-transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MKL2 (siRNA-MKL2). In addition, transfection with miR-142-5p inhibitor significantly increased the expression levels of MKL2, and decreased those of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and 9, and these effects were reversed by transfection with siRNA-MKL2. Finally, MKL2 was proven to be a target of miR-142-5p. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that the downregulation of miR-142-5p inhibits human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSAMC) proliferation and migration possibly by targeting MKL2. Hence, miR-142-5p may prove to be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of AS.">

In the present study, our results indicated that MST1 expression was significantly downregulated in pancreatic cancer cell lines (PANC‑1, BxPC‑3 and HPAC) compared with that in the normal ductal epithelial cell line (hTERT‑HPNE). Moreover, MST1 overexpression in PANC‑1 cells led to increased apoptosis as determined by MTT and TUNEL assays and inhibited cellular migration. Mechanistically, upregulation of MST1 expression caused mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased ATP production, and activation of the mitochondrial‑dependent apoptotic pathway via inhibition of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2)‑mediated mitophagy, which ultimately resulted in increased cellular apoptosis and decreased cellular migration. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that MST1 may regulate pancreatic cancer PANC‑1 cell survival, invasion and migration through Mfn2‑mediated mitophagy, laying the foundation for the exploration of novel therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.">

MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) constitute a novel class of gene regulators, which have important roles in various pathological conditions. The aim of the present study was to identify miRNAs involved in the high glucose (HG)‑induced VSMC phenotype switch, and to investigate the underlying mechanism. miRNA sequencing and reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR results indicated that inhibition of miR‑125a expression increased the migration and proliferation of VSMCs following HG exposure, whereas the overexpression of miR‑125a abrogated this effect. Furthermore, dual‑luciferase reporter assay results identified that 3‑hydroxy‑3-methyglutaryl‑coA reductase (HMGCR), one of the key enzymes in the mevalonate signaling pathway, is a target of miR‑125a. Moreover, HMGCR knockdown, similarly to miR‑125a overexpression, suppressed HG‑induced VSMC proliferation and migration. These results were consistent with those from the miRNA target prediction programs. Using a rat model of streptozotocin‑induced diabetes mellitus, it was demonstrated that miR‑125a expression was gradually downregulated, and that the expressions of key enzymes in the mevalonate signaling pathway in the aortic media were dysregulated after several weeks. In addition, it was found that HG‑induced excessive activation of the mevalonate signaling pathway in VSMCs was suppressed following transfection with a miR‑125a mimic. Therefore, the present results suggest that decreased miR‑125a expression contributed to HG‑induced VSMC proliferation and migration via the upregulation of HMGCR expression. Thus, miR‑125a‑mediated regulation of the mevalonate signaling pathway may be associated with atherosclerosis.">

The expression level of WAVE3 in ESCC tissues was determined via immunohistochemistry, and the relative levels of WAVE3 mRNA and micro (mi)RNA200b were assessed in the serum of patients with ESCC using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). Following cell transfection, the levels of miRNA200b and WAVE3 protein were determined via RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis, and cell migration was examined using a Transwell assay. Subsequently, the clinical parameters were used to analyze whether the expression of WAVE3 in tissues and serum was associated with the occurrence and development of ESCC. The results demonstrated that the expression of WAVE3 was increased in ESCC tissues compared with normal tissues. The results also revealed increased expression levels of WAVE3 and decreased expression levels of miRNA200b in the serum of patients with ESCC, compared with healthy volunteers. High expression of WAVE3 was significantly associated with tumor TNM stage, invasion depth and lymphatic invasion of ESCC. In cells transfected with miRNA200b mimic, the miRNA200b was overexpressed, WAVE3 protein was downregulated and cell migration ability was decreased. The results of the present study suggest that WAVE3 may serve as an oncogene in ESCC, and its inhibition via miRNA200b decreased tumor cell migration. Therefore, WAVE3 may serve as a novel biological marker and therapeutic target for ESCC.">

As knowledge about the European long-tailed duck's life cycle and movement ecology is limited, we investigate its year-round spatiotemporal distribution patterns. Specifically, we aimed to identify the wintering grounds, timing of migration and staging of this population via light-level geolocation. RESULTS:Of the 48 female long-tailed ducks tagged on Kolguev Island (western Russian Arctic), 19 were recaptured to obtain data. After breeding and moulting at freshwater lakes, ducks went out to sea around Kolguev Island and to marine waters ranging from the White Sea to Novaya Zemlya Archipelago for 33 ± 10 days. After a rapid autumn migration, 18 of 19 birds spent their winter in the Baltic Sea and one bird in the White Sea, where they stayed for 212 ± 3 days. There, they used areas known to host long-tailed ducks, but areas differed among individuals. After a rapid spring migration in mid-May, the birds spent 23 ± 3 days at sea in coastal areas between the White Sea and Kolguev Island, before returning to their freshwater breeding habitats in June. CONCLUSIONS:The Baltic Sea represents the most important wintering area for female long-tailed ducks from Kolguev Island. Important spring and autumn staging areas include the Barents Sea and the White Sea. Climate change will render these habitats more exposed to human impacts in the form of fisheries, marine traffic and oil exploitation in near future. Threats that now operate in the wintering areas may thus spread to the higher latitude staging areas and further increase the pressure on long-tailed ducks.">

However, the association between cancer recurrence and the use of local anesthesia is inconclusive and most reports are based on single local anesthetic results. METHODS:The biological effects (growth, migration and survival) of four common local anesthetics on esophageal carcinoma cells were compared. Biochemical assays on molecules involved in cell migration and proliferation were analyzed. RESULTS:Ropivacaine and bupivacaine significantly inhibited esophageal carcinoma cell migration, at clinically relevant micromolar concentrations. Mepivacaine and lidocaine showed less potent cell migration inhibition than ropivacaine or bupivacaine. All four local anesthetics inhibited cell proliferation. Of note, the effective concentration of anti-proliferative activities requires higher doses. At millimolar concentrations of these local anesthetics, cell apoptosis was moderately affected. Drug combination analysis demonstrated that two of four local anesthetics augmented chemotherapeutic drugs in inhibiting migration. However, all four local anesthetics significantly augmented chemotherapeutic drugs in inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis. The anti-growth and anti-survival effects of four local anesthetics were attributed to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage. The anti-migratory effect of local anesthetics is likely through decreasing Rac1 activity. CONCLUSIONS:Our work demonstrates the differential effects and proposes the mechanisms of local anesthetics on esophageal carcinoma cell migration, growth, survival and chemosensitivity.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:People with migration background and dementia are a vulnerable group. Providing care for this group is a public health challenge in Europe. An increasing number of countries are issuing national dementia plans, but a systematic overview of national dementia plans of European countries focusing on care for people with migration background is lacking. This study aims to illustrate how European countries identify the dementia-related needs of people with migration background and whether there are specific healthcare services for them at the national level. METHODS:A qualitative analysis of national dementia plans of the EU and EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries was carried out. Using the discourse analysis model according to Rainer Keller (2011), documents were systematically screened for their relation to migration via keyword and context analysis. The content of the migration-related sections was analyzed using the methods of paraphrasing, memos, comments, and open coding. RESULTS:Twenty-three of the 35 EU and ETFA countries have a national dementia plan, ten of these documents refer to migration and one country (Austria) has a national dementia plan with a chapter on migration. Eight national dementia plans identify that people with migration background and dementia have special needs, and actions to care for this group are planned in nine countries. However, only Norway, Northern Ireland, and the Netherlands refer to available healthcare services for people with migration background. Overall, the topic of migration plays a subordinate role in the national dementia plans of European countries. CONCLUSIONS:The current lack of migrant-specific healthcare services in almost all European countries may lead to denying the right to appropriate care to a growing population. The topic of migration must be given greater attention in national dementia plans. European countries should develop strategies with specific services that address the needs of people with migration background. To improve comparability at the European level, a common definition of migration is needed. Further studies should include country-specific problems related to dementia and migration.">

        <span class="abst" title="CD147 is a widely expressed matrix metalloproteinase inducer involved in the regulation of cell migration. The high glycosylation and ability to undergo oligomerization have been linked to CD147 function, yet there is limited understanding on the molecular mechanisms behind these processes. The current study demonstrates that the expression of Golgi α1,2-mannosidase I is key to maintaining the cell surface organization of CD147 during cell migration. Using an in vitro model of stratified human corneal epithelial wound healing, we show that CD147 is clustered within lateral plasma membranes at the leading edge of adjacent migrating cells. This localization correlates with a surge in matrix metalloproteinase activity and an increase in the expression of α1,2-mannosidase subtype IC (MAN1C1). Global inhibition of α1,2-mannosidase I activity with deoxymannojirimycin markedly attenuates the glycosylation of CD147 and disrupts its surface distribution at the leading edge, concomitantly reducing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9. Likewise, treatment with deoxymannojirimycin or siRNA-mediated knockdown of MAN1C1 impairs the ability of the carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 to stimulate CD147 clustering in unwounded cells. We conclude that the mannose-trimming activity of α1,2-mannosidase I coordinates the clustering and compartmentalization of CD147 that follows an epithelial injury.">

Electrical fields (EFs) have significant effects on cancer cell migration (galvanotaxis/electrotaxis), however, their role as a regulator of cancer progression and metastasis is poorly understood. Here, we employed unique probe systems to characterize the electrical properties of cancer cells and their migratory ability under an EF. Subcutaneous tumors were established from a triple-negative murine breast cancer cell line (4T1), electric currents and potentials of tumors were measured using vibrating probe and glass microelectrodes, respectively. Steady outward and inward currents could be detected at different positions on the tumor surface and magnitudes of the electric currents on the tumor surface strongly correlated with tumor weights. Potential measurements also showed the non-homogeneous intratumor electric potentials. Cancer cell migration was then surveyed in the presence of EFs in vitro. Parental 4T1 cells and metastatic sublines in isolation showed random migration in EFs of physiological strength, whereas cells in monolayer migrated collectively to the anode. Our data contribute to an improved understanding of breast cancer metastasis, providing new evidence in support of an electrical mechanism that promotes this phenomenon.">

However, the role of circRNAs in cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. CircRNA microarrays performed on the immortal cervical cell line H8 and the cervical cancer cell line SiHa were used to identify a circRNA, termed circNRIP1 (hsa_circ_0004771), which was upregulated in SiHa. QRT-PCR confirmed that circNRIP1 was upregulated in CC tissues, where its expression was correlated with lymphovascular space invasion. Besides, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that circNRIP1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, we found that miR-629-3p induced tumor suppression by regulating PTP4A1 and the ERK1/2 pathway. Finally, we confirmed that circNRIP1 exerts its effect, at least partially, by sponging miR-629-3p and thereby regulating the PTP4A1/ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, circNRIP1 may be useful as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CC patients.">

Macrophages display a spectrum of behaviors from tumor-suppressive to tumor-promoting, and their function is spatially and temporally dependent upon integrated signals from the tumor microenvironment including, but not limited to, cytokines, metabolites, and hypoxia. Through years of investigation, the specific biochemical cues that recruit and activate tumor-promoting macrophage functions within the tumor microenvironment are becoming clear. In contrast, the impact of biomechanical stimuli on macrophage activation has been largely underappreciated, however there is a growing body of evidence that physical cues from the extracellular matrix can influence macrophage migration and behavior. While the complex, heterogeneous nature of the extracellular matrix and the transient nature of macrophage activation make studying macrophages in their native tumor microenvironment challenging, this review highlights the importance of investigating how the extracellular matrix directly and indirectly impacts tumor-associated macrophage activation. Additionally, recent advances in investigating macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and future directions regarding mechano-immunomodulation in cancer will also be discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="In late December 2019, patients of atypical pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Subsequently, a novel coronavirus was identified as the causative pathogen which was named SARS-CoV-2. As of 12 February 2020, more than 44 000 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in China and continue to expand. Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China have launched first-level response to major public health emergencies one after another from 23 January 2020, which means restricting movement of people among provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and to depict the effect of restricting population movement. In this study, Excel 2010 was used to demonstrate the temporal distribution at the day level and SPSS 23.0 was used to analyse the correlation between the migration scale index and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. We found that since 23 January 2020, Wuhan migration scale index has dropped significantly and since 26 January 2020, Hubei province migration scale index has dropped significantly. New confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Wuhan gradually increased since 24 January 2020, and showed a downward trend from 6 February 2020. New confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Hubei province gradually increased since 24 January 2020, and maintained at a high level from 24 January 2020 to 4 February 2020, then showed a downward trend. Wuhan migration scale index from 9 January to 22 January, 10 January to 23 January and 11 January to 24 January was correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Wuhan from 22 January to 4 February. Hubei province migration scale index from 10 January to 23 January and 11 January to 24 January was correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per day in China except for Hubei province from 22 January to 4 February. Our findings suggested that people who left Wuhan from 9 January to 22 January, and those who left Hubei province from 10 January to 24 January, led to the outbreak in the rest of China. The 'Wuhan lockdown' and the launching of the first-level response to this major public health emergency may have had a good effect on controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. Although new COVID-19 cases continued to be confirmed in China outside Wuhan and Hubei provinces, in our opinion, these are second-generation cases.">

        <span class="abst" title="Migration is typically thought to be an evolved trait driven by responses to forage or predation, but recent studies have demonstrated avoidance of parasitism can also affect success of migratory tactics within a population. We evaluated hypotheses of how migration alters parasite exposure in a partially migratory elk (Cervus canadensis) population in and adjacent to Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada. Equal numbers of elk remain year-round on the winter range or migrate to summer range. We quantified diversity and abundance of parasites in faecal elk pellets, and prevalence (number of infected individuals) and intensity (egg counts) of giant liver fluke eggs (Fascioloides magna) in faeces across migratory tactics. We tested whether giant liver fluke intensity in faeces was affected by elk use of wetlands, elevation, forage biomass, and elk concentration in the previous summer. We rejected the &quot;migratory escape&quot; hypothesis that suggests migration allowed elk to escape parasite exposure because migrant elk had the highest richness and evenness of parasite groups. We also rejected the hypothesis that prevalence was highest at highest summer densities because higher-density resident elk had the lowest diversity and giant liver fluke egg presence and intensity. Instead, the high prevalence and intensity of giant liver flukes in migrants was consistent with both the hypothesis of &quot;environmental tracking&quot;, because elk that migrated earlier may expose themselves to favourable parasite conditions, and with the &quot;environmental sampling&quot; hypothesis, because giant liver fluke intensity increased with increased exposure to secondary host habitat (i.e., wetland). Our results indicate that differential exposure of different migratory tactics that leave the winter range has a greater influence on parasites than the concentration of elk that reside on the winter range year-round.">

In addition, kindlin‑2 was overexpressed and knocked down in two cell lines to study its effect in cervical cancer cells. The results revealed that kindlin‑2 promoted cell autophagy and inactivated AKT/mTOR signaling. Rescue experiments indicated that the regulation of autophagy by kindlin‑2 was dependent on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, it was revealed that kindlin‑2 inhibited cell migration, and autophagy was required for this process.

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is one of the most lethal malignancies in women worldwide. Many studies showed the transcription factor SNAI2-induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) through inhibiting E-cadherin (E-cad) expression. Our previous study reported that miR-222-3p was an important tumor-suppressive miRNA for EOC development and dissemination. The present study aimed to acquire a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of miR-222-3p regulation that might contribute to improving current anti-metastasis strategies in EOC. Methods: A variety of techniques were used to measure mRNA and protein expression levels, including quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and immunofluorescence (IF). Four different microRNA (miRNA) target prediction databases were used to predict the target genes of miR-222. Luciferase assay was performed to determine the direct binding of miR-222-3p to the untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PDCD10. The biological effects of PDCD10 and miR-222-3p were also investigated in vitro by Transwell and wound healing assays, as well as in vivo by a xenograft mice model. Combining UCSC and JASPAR, as well as ENCODE public databases, we predicted that the transcription factor SNAI2 could affect miR-222-3p expression. Luciferase assay was utilized to examine the validity of putative SNAI2 binding sites for miR-222-3p regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to explore the SNAI2's occupancy on the miR-222-3p promoter. Results: We observed the inhibitory effect of SNAI2 on miR-222-3p transcription and confirmed the tumor-suppressive function of miR-222-3p both in EOC cells and tissues. PDCD10 was upregulated and inversely correlated with miR-222-3p, both in vitro and in vivo, which was consistent with the information in bioinformatics databases. Furthermore, We observed direct binding of miR-222-3p to the 3'-UTR of PDCD10 and inhibition of PDCD10 translation, which, in turn, inhibited EOC cell migration in vitro and repressed EOC xenografted tumor metastasis in vivo. We found that genetic overexpression of PDCD10 (OE-PDCD10) increased cancer metastasis by down-regulating E-cad and enhancing Vimentin (VIM) thereby inducing EMT and promoting β-catenin/Wnt-mediated cell migration.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Tetraspanins constitute a family of transmembrane spanning proteins that function mainly by organizing the plasma membrane into micro-domains. CD82, a member of tetraspanins, is a potent inhibitor of cancer metastasis in numerous malignancies. CD82 is a highly glycosylated protein, however, it is still unknown whether and how this post-translational modification affects CD82 function and cancer metastasis. Methods: The glycosylation of CD82 profiles are checked in the paired human ovarian primary and metastatic cancer tissues. The functional studies on the various glycosylation sites of CD82 are performed in vitro and in vivo. Results: We demonstrate that CD82 glycosylation at Asn157 is necessary for CD82-mediated inhibition of ovarian cancer cells migration and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we discover that CD82 glycosylation is pivotal to disrupt integrin α5β1-mediated cellular adhesion to the abundant extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Thereby the glycosylated CD82 inhibits the integrin signaling pathway responsible for the induction of the cytoskeleton rearrangements required for cellular migration. Furthermore, we reveal that the glycosyltransferase MGAT3 is responsible for CD82 glycosylation in ovarian cancer cells. Metastatic ovarian cancers express reduced levels of MGAT3 which in turn may result in impaired CD82 glycosylation. Conclusions: Our work implicates a pathway for ovarian cancers metastasis regulation via MGAT3 mediated glycosylation of tetraspanin CD82 at asparagine 157.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background: Gliomas are the most prevalent primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Our previous study showed that miR-204-5p is a tumor suppressor gene in glioma. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is a potential target gene of miR-204-5p. Methods: We analyzed the expression of XIST and miR-204-5p in glioma tissues and the correlation with glioma grade. A series of in vitro experiments were carried out to elucidate the role of XIST in glioma progression. A mouse xenograft model was established to detect whether knockdown of XIST can inhibit glioma growth. A luciferase assay was performed to determine whether XIST can bind to miR-204-5p and the binding specificity. Cells stably expressing shXIST or shNC were transfected with anti-miR-204-5p or anti-miR-204-5p-NC to evaluate whether XIST mediates the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-204-5p. Results: XIST was upregulated in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues (NBTs), while miR-204-5p expression was significantly decreased in glioma tissues compared with NBTs. Both XIST and miR-204-5p expression levels were clearly related to glioma grade, and the expression of XIST was obviously negatively correlated with miR-204-5p expression. Knockdown of XIST inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, promoted apoptosis of glioma cells, inhibited tumor growth and increased the survival time in nude mice. miR-204-5p could directly bind to XIST and negatively regulate XIST expression. XIST mediated glioma progression by targeting miR-204-5p in glioma cells. XIST crosstalk with miR-204-5p regulated Bcl-2 expression to promote apoptosis. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that XIST, miR-204-5p and Bcl-2 form a regulatory axis that controls glioma progression and can serve as a potential therapeutic target for glioma.">

Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) and its regulators have been suggested to play a role in cell migration and tissue repair. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of a novel Sirt1 activator, the piper amide derivative (E)‑3‑(2,4‑dichlorophenyl)‑N‑phenylacrylamide, also known as NED416, on cutaneous wound healing. The effects of NED416 on Sirt1 activity, Sirt1 expression, and angiogenesis were measured in skin and endothelial cells (epidermal keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells) using a Sirt1 activity assay kit, western blot analysis and tube formation assays, respectively. The effects of NED416 on the rate of wound closure and collagen deposition were measured via H&amp;E staining and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Levels of migration‑related [Rac1, cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) and α‑p21‑activated kinase] and mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway proteins were measured in hairless mice via western blot analysis. NED416 significantly increased Sirt1 activity in dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes to a greater extent than resveratrol, leading to increased cell migration and angiogenesis through Rac1/Cdc42 and ERK/JNK activation. Furthermore, NED416 accelerated wound closure, macrophage infiltration, and epithelium and collagen formation in vivo. The present study demonstrated a role of Sirt1 in cutaneous wound healing, and suggested that NED416 as a Sirt1 activator is more potent than resveratrol in promoting wound healing through Rac1/Cdc42 and MAPK signaling without toxicity, thus serving as a promising candidate for treatment.">

        <span class="abst" title="Low‑density lipoprotein receptor‑related protein 6 (LRP6) promotes metastasis in numerous types of cancer; however, its role in trophoblast cells has been less frequently reported. In the present study, the effects of up‑ and downregulation of LRP6 on trophoblast cells were investigated accordingly. The study aimed to develop a therapeutic target for gestational choriocarcinoma. The expression levels of LRP6 in pre‑eclampsia (PE) tissues, trophoblast cell lines and gestational choriocarcinoma cells were determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) assay. Double‑luciferase reporter analysis was conducted to detect the regulatory gene of LRP6. Furthermore, the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of trophoblasts and gestational choriocarcinoma cells were determined by CCK‑8, wound healing, and Transwell assays, respectively. The expression levels of the genes and proteins of interest [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)‑2, MMP‑9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase‑1 (TIMP‑1), and TIMP‑2] associated with tumor cell invasion were measured by performing RT‑qPCR and western blotting, respectively. The National Center for Biotechnology Information database revealed that LRP6 was relatively highly expressed in placental tissues, but was poorly expressed in PE tissues and trophoblast cell lines. The upregulation of LRP6 not only increased the activity, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells, but it also promoted the expression of MMP‑2 and MMP‑9, whereas it inhibited the expression levels of TIMP‑1 and TIMP‑2. Such results followed the opposite trend to those of downregulation of LRP6 in gestational choriocarcinoma cells. Moreover, LRP6 was predicted to be the target gene for microRNA (miR)‑346, which was highly expressed in PE tissues and trophoblast cell lines. The present study also revealed that LRP6 could reverse the effects of miR‑346 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells. Therefore, considered collectively, the results of the present study have demonstrated that LRP6 is involved in the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells via miR‑346, and that LRP6 may serve as a potential target in cancer treatment.">

These additional variations make it difficult to estimate parameters during speciation with gene flow, as the pattern of these additional variations differs with the relationship between isolation and migration. As far as we know, most methods rely on the assumption about the relationship between isolation and migration by a given model, such as the isolation-with-migration model, when estimating parameters during speciation with gene flow. In this article, we develop a multispecies coalescent approach which does not rely on any assumption about the relationship between isolation and migration when estimating parameters and is called mstree. mstree is available at https://github.com/liujunfengtop/MStree/ and uses some mathematical inequalities among several factors, which include the species divergence time, the ancestral population size, and the number of gene trees, to estimate parameters during speciation with gene flow. Using simulations, we show that the estimated values of ancestral population sizes and species divergence times are close to the true values when analyzing the simulation data sets, which are generated based on the isolation-with-initial-migration model, secondary contact model, and isolation-with-migration model. Therefore, our method is able to estimate ancestral population sizes and speciation times in the presence of different modes of gene flow and may be helpful to test different theories of speciation.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of lung cancer (LC), which is the most common tumor worldwide. Accumulating evidence has elucidated an important role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mediating the development and progression of several tumors. The purpose of this study was to explore the role and underlying mechanism of miR-15b in LUAD. METHODS:CCK-8 and Transwell assays were conducted to measure the capacities of cell viability and migration in SPC-A1 cells. Luciferase assay was utilized to verifymiR-15b direct binding to BCL2 mRNA 3'-UTR. RESULTS:We determined that miR-15b was overexpressed in LUAD and miR-15b overexpression predicted a significantly worse outcome in patients with LUAD. miR-15b improved LUAD growth in vitro and vivo. miR-15b enhanced cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in LUAD. miR-15b promoted cell viability, migration and EMT through inhibiting BCL2 expression by targeting to its mRNA 3'-UTR. BCL2 reversed functions of miR-15b on promoting cell proliferation, migration and EMT in SPC-A1 cells. CONCLUSIONS:miR-15b promoted cell viability, migration and EMT by targeting BCL2 in LUAD. The newly identified miR-15b/BCL2 axis provides a novel insight into the pathogenesis of LUAD.">

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the functional role of miR-125b in regulating breast cancer progression. METHODS:We used the StarBase database to investigate the expression of miRNA-125b in breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues. MMP11 3'-UTR construct and luciferase reporter assays was performed for target genes. Cell proliferation was evaluated by CCK-8 and colony formation assay. The migration and invasion were assessed by transwell assay. RESULTS:Luciferase reporter assays showed miRNA-125b directly targeted MMP11. miRNA-125b by transfection with its mimic in breast cancer cells significantly suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Western blot revealed that overexpression of miRNA-125b substantially reduced MMP11 protein expression. We used the UALCAN database to investigate the expression of MMP11 in human breast cancer and adjacent normal tissues. In addition, we found that miRNA-125b spoiled MMP11 induced breast cancer cell proliferation and migration promotion effect. CONCLUSIONS:miRNA-125b mimic inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells through targeting MMP11 protein.">

The object of the present study was to explore the effects of PRP3 in a common metastatic skin cancer, keratinocyte-derived cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCCs). RT-qPCR and western blotting were conducted to measure the expression levels of PRP3 in various cSCC cell lines and cSCC tissues. A benign epidermal keratinocyte cell line was transfected with a eukaryotic expression plasmid to overexpress PRP3. In addition, the endogenous expression level of PRP3 in cSCC cells was silenced using a short hairpin RNA method, and the role of PRP3 on cell proliferation and migration was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, wound healing assay and Transwell assays following knockdown in cSCC cells, and overexpression in keratinovcyte cells. Elevated levels of PRP3 mRNA and protein were noted in cSCC cell lines or cSCC tissues compared with actinic keratosis (AK) or benign epidermal keratinocyte cell line, respectively. Upregulation of PRP3 expression was found to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with cSCCs. The upregulation of PRP3 promoted cell viability, metastasis and the activity of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in epidermal keratinocyte cells. Interestingly, loss of PRP3 had no obvious impact on cell viability and migration in benign epidermal keratinocyte cells. Functionally, the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway reversed the increased cell viability and migration of cSCC cells induced by PRP3. Taken together, the present observations indicated that PRP3 served as a tumor active factor in cSCCs by targeting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Moreover, it is implied that impeding the PRP3 activity may selectively constrain cancer cell growth and migration with limited effect on normal skin cells.">

Risk factors were interchangeable, and migration was among the explored risks. Alarmed by these data, we assessed collected risk load in young ‘healthy’ refugees as a specific subgroup of current migration streams and evaluated first signals of behavioral abnormalities.MethodsIn 9 German refugee centers, n = 133 young refugees, not previously in contact with the health system, were recruited, many of them unaccompanied minors. Risk factors experienced apart from migration/refuge were carefully assessed: Traumatic experiences before/during/after flight (including war, genocide, human trafficking, torture, murder, slavery, terrorist attacks), urbanicity, physical and sexual abuse, problematic alcohol and cannabis use (lifetime). Evaluation comprised physical exam and psychopathology screening.FindingsRefugees arrived in Germany via Eastern Mediterranean/Balkan route (34.6%), from Africa via Central Mediterranean route (39.1%), by plane (17.3%) or other routes, such as Western Mediterranean or Atlantic (9.0%). Flight reasons were war/expulsion (25.6%), persecution/threats to life (51.9%), economical/others (22.5%). On top of migration/refuge, 42.8% of subjects had ≥3 risk factors; only 4.5% of refugees had no additional risks. Global level of functioning and severity of psychopathology were strongly associated with number of accumulated risks (Jonckheere–Terpstra trend-test: p = 7.61 × 10−7 and p = 3.62 × 10−7, respectively).InterpretationYoung refugees, arriving in hosting countries with alarming 'risk burden', should be considered as highly vulnerable towards development of global functional deficits, behavioral abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Rapid proactive integration or sustainable support of those who will return to rebuild their countries are mandatory.FundingThe Max Planck Society supported this work.">

In this article, we report the findings from a survey of n = 1148 academics working in universities in the United Kingdom (UK) and representing all the major disciplines and career hierarchy. Respondents report an abundance of what we call ‘afflictions’ exacted upon their role as educators and in far fewer yet no less visible ways ‘affordances’ derived from their rapid transition to online provision and early ‘entry-level’ use of digital pedagogies. Overall, they suggest that online migration is engendering significant dysfunctionality and disturbance to their pedagogical roles and their personal lives.

In the last several years, more and more studies have demonstrated the significant roles played by circular RNAs (circRNAs) in different human tumors progression including NSCLC. The present study was to explore the mechanism of hsa_circ_101237 in regulating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Totally 303 NSCLC cases were enrolled. A549 and H1299 cells were transfected. Cells viability, migration and invasion were determined by CCK-8 assay and transwell experiment, respectively. Luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were performed. hsa_circ_101237, miR-490-3p and MAPK1 expression in tissues/cells were detected by qRT-PCR. The study found an elevation in the expression of Hsa_circRNA_101237 in both NSCLC tissues and cell line. High Hsa_circRNA_101237 expression predicted poor survival in NSCLC. Meanwhile, we found that hsa_circRNA_101237 expression sponged miR-490-3p to enhance MAPK1 expression, thus significantly promoting NSCLC cell lines proliferation, migration, and invasion. MAPK1 restoration prevented NSCLC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion to be repressed due to hsa_circRNA_101237 knockdown. To sum up, as revealed by the study, hsa_circRNA_101237 promoted the expression of MAPK1 via miRNA-490-3p sponge, thus affecting the NSCLC as an important onco-circRNA.">

However, health outcomes in the early stages are expected to be similar to the health outcomes associated with refugees. The objective of the present study was a systematic review of the health effects of migration caused by climate change.METHODOLOGY:A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were used to identify papers published that evaluated the health effects of migration caused by climate change. The search, article selection, and data extraction were carried out by two researchers independently. All English-language articles on the health effects of migration caused by climate change were included in this study.RESULTS:An analysis of the complex ways in which climate change influences populations can be facilitated using a three-class classification: compulsory displacement, resettlement planning, and migration. Subsequent to climate changes, other changes, and environmental deficiencies, compulsory displacement may occur in case of inadequacy of compatibility responses. A part of migration-related health outcomes caused by climate change is from displacement from rural to urban areas, especially in developing countries. There is significant documentation on health and livelihood inequalities between migrant groups and host populations in developed countries.CONCLUSION:If climate change continues in its current direction, it is likely that the number of refugees and crises will increase in the coming decades. Although the domain and the extent of health hazards caused by the displacement of the population associated with climate change cannot be clearly predicted, by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, along with social and environmental adaptation strategies, migration caused by climate change, health risks and its relevant crises can be greatly reduced.">
