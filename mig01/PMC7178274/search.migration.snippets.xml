  <result pre="different in other implant designs. The presented results showed a" exact="migration" post="along the taper axis with higher values after implantation"/>

  <result pre="the femoral head is one of the pathogenesis of head–taper" exact="migration" post="[31]. According to the presented in vitro experiment, after"/>
  <result pre="is speculated that in the early post-operative period, the head–taper" exact="migration" post="was dominated by reasons induced by mechanical/material deformation, and"/>
  <result pre="a relatively lower migration. However, exploring the causes of head–taper" exact="migration" post="in each specific period is beyond the scope of"/>
  <result pre="to relative motion over time [32]. In addition to the" exact="migration" post="along the longitudinal axis of the taper, the femoral"/>
  <result pre="axis of the taper, the femoral head prosthesis revealed also" exact="migration" post="in other directions perpendicular to the taper. According to"/>
  <result pre="to previous literature, the authors believe that this type of" exact="migration" post="was caused by the fretting corrosion in-between the head–taper"/>
