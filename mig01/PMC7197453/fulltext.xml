Controlling donor T cell migration into peripheral tissues is a viable option to limit unwanted tissue damage, but a lack of specific targets limits progress on this front. Here, we show that the adaptor protein CrkL, but not the closely related family members CrkI or CrkII, is a crucial regulator of T cell migration. <italic>In vitro</italic>, CrkL-deficient T cells fail to polymerize actin in response to the integrin ligand ICAM-1, resulting in defective migration. Using a mouse model of GvHD/GVT, we found that while CrkL-deficient T cells can efficiently eliminate hematopoietic tumors they are unable to migrate into inflamed organs, such as the liver and small intestine, and thus do not cause GvHD. These results suggest a specific role for CrkL in trafficking to peripheral organs but not the lymphatic system. In line with this, we found that although CrkL-deficient T cells could clear hematopoietic tumors, they failed to clear the same tumor growing subcutaneously, highlighting the role of CrkL in controlling T cell migration into peripheral tissues. Our results define a unique role for CrkL in controlling T cell migration, and suggest that CrkL function could be therapeutically targeted to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies involving allogeneic donor cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>graft-versus-host disease</kwd><kwd>CrkL</kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>T cell migration out of the vasculature into peripheral tissue is a key control point in the inflammatory response. Although trafficking to tissues is required for protective immunity, uncontrolled T cell infiltration into tissue can result in exacerbated inflammation and tissue damage. T cell recruitment is highly regulated by the local endothelial cells which, in response to pro-inflammatory cues, up-regulate molecules such as chemokines and adhesion receptors. These molecules promote T cell adhesion to the endothelial monolayer, and guide migration through the monolayer into the tissue [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The endothelial ligands ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are recognized by the T cell integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4, respectively, which mediate firm adhesion to the vascular wall and subsequent migration into inflamed tissue [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition to acting as adhesion receptors, integrins also initiate downstream signaling events that are important for T cell migration. For instance, ligation of LFA-1 immediately results in T cell polarization, actin polymerization, and migration, all of which are necessary for crossing the endothelial barrier [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Integrin blocking antibodies have been used successfully to treat multiple sclerosis and other inflammatory diseases, but this approach interferes with a broad range of responses. Disruption of signaling events downstream of engaged integrins could yield more context-specific therapies, but to develop such strategies, a better understanding of the relevant signaling pathways is required.</p><p>We recently identified the CT10 Regulator of Kinase (Crk) family of adapter proteins as crucial intermediaries that link LFA-1 engagement to actin responses and migration in T cells [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Activated T cells lacking Crk proteins fail to polymerize actin downstream of LFA-1, and migrate slower and less directionally than their WT counterparts [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Importantly, these mutant T cells also have defects in crossing endothelial monolayers <italic>in vitro</italic>, and they fail to traffic to sites of inflammation <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, using a clinically relevant mouse model of graft-versus-host disease/graft-versus-leukemia (GvHD/GVL), we showed that T cells lacking Crk proteins can efficiently clear tumor cells but cause little-to-no GvHD pathology [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consistent with the view that Crk proteins mediate integrin-dependent trafficking in a tissue-specific manner, we found that Crk deficient T cells could not migrate to the target GvHD organs liver and small intestine (SI), although they trafficked efficiently to the secondary lymphoid organs spleen and lymph nodes. These findings identify Crk proteins as potential targets for tissue-selective disruption of integrin-dependent inflammatory responses.</p><p>Development of Crk proteins as therapeutic targets requires addressing redundancy among family members. The Crk family consists of three isoforms transcribed from two loci. CrkI and CrkII are transcribed from the <italic>crk</italic> locus, while the paralog CrkL is transcribed from the <italic>crkl</italic> locus. These proteins are composed of a single N-terminal SH2 domain, followed by either two consecutive SH3 domains (CrkII and CrkL), or a single SH3 domain (CrkI) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The Crk proteins are widely expressed across tissues and have many biological functions, all of which stem from their role as adaptor proteins that coordinate signaling complexes downstream of cell surface receptors [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Crk proteins are particularly important for adhesion and migration [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They have been shown to localize to adhesion sites and regulate the stability of these structures in non-hematopoietic cells [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and alterations in their expression is associated with invasive potential in several tumors [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Crk family members share many of the same binding partners, and they have been shown to have overlapping functions in some processes [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, there are clear instances (most notably during development) where the Crk proteins have non-overlapping roles, showing that in some instances they have evolved separate functions [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All of our previous work defining the role of Crk proteins in T cell migration was performed using a mouse floxed for both the <italic>crk</italic> and <italic>crkl</italic> loci and crossed with a CD4-cre mouse, resulting in T cells devoid for all three family members (herein referred to as DKO). Therefore, it is unclear if the Crk family members work together to promote T cell migration, or if only a single Crk isoform is responsible for this function. Now, using T cells lacking either CrkI/II or CrkL, we show that CrkL is the dominant Crk family member that controls T cell migration. T cells lacking CrkI/II show a WT phenotype, whereas T cells lacking CrkL phenocopy DKO T cells in their responses to ICAM-1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> in a GvHD/GVT mouse model. This work has defined a unique role for CrkL in T cell migration, opening the door to novel therapeutic approaches based on targeting CrkL function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>CrkL is needed for T cell spreading and migration in response to the integrin ligand ICAM-1</title><p>We showed previously that T cells lacking all Crk family members exhibit defects in integrin-dependent migration and <italic>in vivo</italic> trafficking [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To ask if this aspect of Crk protein function depends on a single protein isoform or if there is functional redundancy among family members, we used mice that are floxed for either the <italic>crk</italic> or the <italic>crkL</italic> locus, crossed with CD4-Cre mice to specifically delete these loci in T cells. The resulting T cells are lacking either CrkI/II or CrkL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first tested the ability of these T cells to polymerize actin and migrate in response to surface-presented integrin ligands <italic>in vitro</italic>. Rested CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell blasts were prepared as described in Materials and Methods, and then allowed to interact with ICAM-1 coated surfaces, fixed, and labelled with phalloidin to visualize F-actin. As shown previously [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], WT T cells adhered tightly to the surfaces, and formed a polarized morphology characteristic of cells migrating on ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). These WT cells showed strong actin polymerization, especially at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). T cells lacking CrkI/II were indistinguishable from the WT cells. In contrast, DKO and CrkL KO T cells failed to spread, and lacked a clear F-actin-rich leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Quantitation of the total F-actin signal confirmed that DKO and CrkL KO T cells responding to ICAM-1 contained significantly less F-actin than WT or CrkI/II KO T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine if the defects in actin responses result in altered migration, we imaged T cells migrating on ICAM-1 coated surfaces and tracked cell movement. DKO and CrkL KO T cells migrated significantly slower than WT or CrkI/II KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). As we showed previously for DKO T cells [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], loss of a clear actin-rich leading edge also resulted in reduced directional persistence in CrkL KO T cells (data not shown). Together, these data show that the two products of the Crk locus, CrkI and CrkII, are dispensable for actin polymerization and migration downstream of integrin engagement. The CrkL protein is the relevant family member controlling these events in T cells.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>CrkL is required for T cell integrin responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of T cells purified from WT or knockout mice.

In this model, GvHD occurs in a subset of organs and involves early migration of alloreactive T cells into these organs followed by T cell expansion and later tissue destruction [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To test the role of the individual Crk proteins in GvHD pathology, lethally irradiated BALB/c mice were injected with T-cell depleted C57BL/6 bone marrow (TCDBM) along with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from WT, DKO, CrkI/II KO, or CrkL KO C57BL/6 mice. In addition, A20 lymphoma cells expressing luciferase were also injected, to determine if the transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells could eliminate tumor cells.

However, because the GvHD/GVT experiments take place over the course of several weeks, it is difficult to establish a causative role for T cell migration in initiating the inflammatory response. We therefore set up a short-term competitive experiment to examine the role of Crk proteins in T cell migration into target GvHD organs. Lethally irradiated BALB/c mice were injected with TCDBM along with a 1:1 mix of WT H-2K<sup>b+</sup> CD45.1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (purified from B6. SJL mice) and either WT, DKO, CrkI/II KO, or CrkL KO CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, all of which are H-2K<sup>b+</sup> CD45.2<sup>+</sup>. Seven days post injection, before the onset of GvHD pathology, the mice were sacrificed and their livers, small intestines, and spleens were processed for flow cytometric analysis. A representative gating strategy to identify donor H-2K<sup>b+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. As expected, when WT CD45.1<sup>+</sup> T cells were mixed with control WT CD45.2<sup>+</sup> T cells, the two were detected in approximately a 1:1 ratio in every organ tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). This was also true for CrkI/II KO T cells, indicating that Crk I and Crk II are dispensable for T cell migration <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, when DKO or CrkL KO T cells were used, these T cells had a significant defect in migration to the liver and the small intestine compared to their CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT counterparts.

If so, one would predict that if the tumor were located in a peripheral tissue outside of the lymphatic system, CrkL KO T cells would not be able to access and kill the tumor. To test this, we set up a GvHD/GVT experiment similar to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, except that the A20 tumor cells were injected subcutaneously as opposed to intravenously.

Interestingly, this <italic>in vitro</italic> phenotype could be rescued by overexpression of any Crk family member [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], raising the possibility that Crk proteins might exhibit functional redundancy with respect to T cell migration. Here, we have carried out more stringent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis using single and double knockout T cells. We show that CrkL, but not CrkI or CrkII, is required for T cell actin polymerization and migration in response to ICAM-1. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> GvHD/GVT model, CrkL deficient T cells failed to traffic to GvHD target organs and did not cause inflammation, but could efficiently clear hematopoietic tumor cells. However, CrkL KO T cells could not clear the same tumor when it was growing subcutaneously, highlighting the role of CrkL in controlling T cell migration into peripheral tissues. Taken together, our studies identify a unique role for CrkL in T cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, opening the door for future studies aimed at disrupting CrkL biology to alter T cell function.</p><p>Crk proteins have long been associated with adhesion and migration in many cell types including fibroblasts, hematopoietic cell lines, and cancer cells [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. They fulfill this function by linking tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to effector proteins that govern adhesion and migration, such as Src and Abl family kinases, GEFs and GAPs [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this way, Crk proteins coordinate multi-protein complexes downstream of cell surface receptors. In T cells, only a small number of proteins are known to interact with Crk proteins [<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Based on our data defining a clear role for CrkL in actin polymerization and T cell migration, it is likely that CrkL has unique binding partners in T cells that mediate these phenotypes. The isolated SH2 and SH3 domains of CrkII and CrkL are very similar and have nearly identical binding affinities for protein ligands [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Nonetheless, the full-length proteins show significant differences. In the intact protein, the SH2 domain of CrkII binds efficiently to tyrosine phosphorylated ligands, whereas the SH2 domain of CrkL shows low binding activity. Conversely, the N-terminal SH3 domain of CrkL binds freely to proline-rich peptides, but this activity is largely masked in CrkII [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further differences are seen upon tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk proteins, where the phosphorylation of CrkII (but not CrkL) further reduces binding to proline-rich ligands. Ligand binding of CrkII is also regulated by proline isomerization [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Since the relevant proline is absent from CrkL, this likely represents another structural difference that regulates isoform-specific binding. Future work aimed at determining the specific binding partners of the different Crk proteins in primary T cells under different phosphorylation and isomerization conditions will be crucial for formulating therapies that alter CrkL dependent signaling pathways to tune T cell function.</p><p>We show that CrkL KO T cells fail to enter inflamed tissues and subcutaneous tumors, but they efficiently access lymphoid tissues. The selective requirement for CrkL in entering inflamed tissue likely reflects the requisite role of CrkL in regulating actin dynamics downstream of integrin engagement. T cells actively migrate on inflamed postcapillary venules and make numerous actin-dependent invadopodia-like protrusions to push their way through the endothelial monolayer [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, the ability of the T cell to polymerize actin, migrate, and probe the endothelium may be defining factors for the ability to cross postcapillary venules. The preferential ability of CrkL KO T cells to access lymph nodes is likely to be attributable to differences in endothelial barriers. To access lymph nodes, T cells must cross high endothelial venules, specialized structures that create large pockets to fully engulf transmigrating T cells, efficiently escorting them across the barrier [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This process may be much less demanding with respect to force generation by the T cell actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>Our studies showing that CrkL mediates integrin responses in migrating T cells expands upon earlier work showing that Crk proteins are important during T cell activation. In that setting, CrkI/II are the best studied family members, but functional redundancy has not been systematically addressed. In particular, CrkII has been documented to bind a handful of proteins downstream of the T cell receptor, including ZAP-70, cCbl, CasL, and even the CD3&#x003b6; chain [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, both CrkII and CrkL have been implicated in LFA-1 activation at the immunological synapse, but they seem to achieve this via different mechanisms. Dephosphorylation of CrkII by SHP-1 controls CrkII&#x02019;s ability to activate Rap1 in the integrin-rich zone of the synapse [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On the other hand, CrkL regulates integrin activation by pathway involving the actin nucleator WAVE2 [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, CrkL has also been implicated in regulating WASp activation downstream of T cell receptor engagement [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These two studies showing that CrkL regulates actin function at the IS, together with the work descried here showing a role for CrkL in actin regulation during T cell migration, raise the interesting possibility that CrkL has specialized for regulating cytoskeletal function. Indeed, there have been no reports of CrkI or CrkII regulating actin dynamics in T cells, lending support to the idea that CrkL has evolved for regulating actin dynamics in T cells.</p><p>Going forward, it will be interesting to identify CrkL binding partners and other signaling molecules needed for integrin-dependent actin responses and passage into inflamed tissues. Targeting these molecules could be used to more finely control T cell trafficking in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and for the design of next-generation adoptive T cell therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Anti-CD3 (2C11) and anti-CD28 (PV1) were from BioXCell.

BALB/c mice (H-2K<sup>d</sup>) were used as recipients in the GvHD/GVL studies. Unless otherwise indicated, all tissue culture reagents were from Gibco. Primary mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified from lymph nodes and spleens by negative selection using anti-MHCII and anti-CD8 hybridoma supernatants (M5/114 and 2.43, respectively) and anti-rat Ig magnetic beads (Qiagen BioMag).
