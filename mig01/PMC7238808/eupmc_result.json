    "BACKGROUND CircPSMC3 has been reported to play important roles in the occurrence and development of cancer. However, the role of circPSMC3 in NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of circPSMC3 in NSCLC tissues was measured through qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). The effect of circPSMC3 on the invasion and migration of NSCLC cell line H1299 was determined through transwell invasion assay and wound healing assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed for exploring the regulatory interaction between circPSMC3, miR-182-5p, and NME2. RESULTS Compared with adjacent normal tissues, the expression of circPSMC3 in NSCLC tissues was decreased. Lower circPSMC3 expression was closely associated with lymph node metastasis and higher TNM stage in NSCLC patients. Biological function analysis suggested that circPSMC3 inhibits the invasion and migration of H1299 cells through upregulating the expression of NME2. Mechanistically, circPSMC3 sponges miR-182-5p to suppress the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells via upregulating NME2 expression. CONCLUSIONS CircPSMC3 inhibits the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells through the miR-182-5p/NME2 signaling pathway."
