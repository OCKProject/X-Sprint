In the present study, the effects of up- and down-regulation of LRP6 on trophoblast cells were investigated accordingly. The study aimed to develop a therapeutic target for gestational choriocarcinoma. The expression levels of LRP6 in pre-eclampsia (PE) tissues, trophoblast cell lines and gestational choriocarcinoma cells were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. Double-luciferase reporter analysis was conducted to detect the regulatory gene of LRP6. Furthermore, the proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of trophoblasts and gestational choriocarcinoma cells were determined by CCK-8, wound healing, and Transwell assays, respectively. The expression levels of the genes and proteins of interest [matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metallo-proteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and TIMP-2] associated with tumor cell invasion were measured by performing RT-qPCR and western blotting, respectively. The National Center for Biotechnology Information database revealed that LRP6 was relatively highly expressed in placental tissues, but was poorly expressed in PE tissues and trophoblast cell lines. The upregulation of LRP6 not only increased the activity, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells, but it also promoted the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas it inhibited the expression levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Such results followed the opposite trend to those of downregulation of LRP6 in gestational choriocarcinoma cells. Moreover, LRP6 was predicted to be the target gene for microRNA (miR)-346, which was highly expressed in PE tissues and trophoblast cell lines. The present study also revealed that LRP6 could reverse the effects of miR-346 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells. Therefore, considered collectively, the results of the present study have demonstrated that LRP6 is involved in the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells via miR-346, and that LRP6 may serve as a potential target in cancer treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pre-eclampsia</kwd><kwd>trophoblast cells</kwd><kwd>low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertensive disorders emerge during pregnancy, including gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia (PE), eclampsia, chronic hypertension complicated with PE, and chronic hypertension (<xref rid="b1-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). PE, which is mainly characterized by maternal proteinuria and hypertension, is one of the main causes of maternal and perinatal mortality (<xref rid="b2-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The morbidity rate due to PE is increasing, although the etiology and pathogenesis of PE are not fully understood; therefore, clinical treatment strategies available to treat the disease are currently limited (<xref rid="b4-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). According to the latest published articles, the proliferation, invasion and migration of trophoblast cells into the uterus serve important roles in human placenta formation and embryo implantation (<xref rid="b5-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Decreased invasive ability, and increased apoptosis, of trophoblast cells are two major causes of PE during the critical stage of placental implantation (<xref rid="b7-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Once certain changes in the regulatory factors have taken place, trophoblast cells will greatly proliferate and develop into choriocarcinoma, which causes damage to the tissues and blood vessels surrounding the uterus, and distant metastasis at an early stage. Therefore, regulating the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells has a positive significance for the treatment of PE and related diseases.</p><p>Previous studies (<xref rid="b8-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) have highlighted that the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) leads to upregulation of the levels of inflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; and interleukin-6, in the body, and may decrease the cell invasive ability of trophoblasts and promote cell apoptosis, thereby resulting in abnormal development of placenta and the occurrence of PE. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is highly expressed in placental tissues. Previous studies have confirmed that LRP6 serves a critical role in promoting the migration and invasion of numerous types of cancers; for example, Liu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b10-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) reported that LRP6 is upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and that its overexpression is an important factor contributing to cancer cell migration and invasion. Therefore, it was possible to hypothesize that LRP6 may be involved in regulating the migration and invasive abilities of trophoblast cells.</p><p>The current study aimed to determine the expression levels of LRP6 in PE tissues and trophoblast cell lines, to explore the effects of upregulated and downregulated LRP6 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells, and to further probe the relevant targets and mechanisms. Furthermore, the mechanism of migration and invasion of trophoblast cells was also explored so as to provide a probable therapeutic target for the treatment of PE and other related diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 40 patients diagnosed with PE (<xref rid="b11-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) who attended the Qilu Hospital of Shandong University from January to December 2018 were enrolled for the present study.

Moreover, microscopic images and quantitative analysis revealed that overexpressed LRP6 led to a measurable increase in the migratory distance and invasion rate of the HTR8/SVneo cells, while the effects of poorly expressed LRP6 on JEG-3 cells followed an opposite trend (P&#x0003c;0.05; <xref rid="f3-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). Furthermore, the RT-qPCR and WB analyses revealed that upregulating LRP6 led to promotion of the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9, although the expression levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in HTR8/SVneo cells were suppressed. Again, it was noted that the effects of siLRP6 on JEG-3 cells followed an opposite trend compared with the effects of overexpressed LRP6 (P&#x0003c;0.001; <xref rid="f3-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-L</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Downregulated miR-346 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells</title><p>According to the TargetScan prediction, nt positions 99-105 of the LRP6 3&#x02032;-UTR are able to bind to miR-346 (<xref rid="f4-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

Accordingly, RT-qPCR and WB analysis revealed that upregulated miR-346 could increase the expression levels of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, although the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the two cell lines were decreased, and these results showed the opposite trend to those performed with downregulated miR-346 (P&#x0003c;0.05; <xref rid="f7-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-F</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>LRP6 reverses the inhibitory effect of miR-346 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells</title><p>According to the results of RT-qPCR and WB analysis, the expression level of LRP6 was gradually downregulated by the upregulation of miR-346, but it was markedly upregulated by downregulating miR-346 (P&#x0003c;0.05; <xref rid="f7-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G-L</xref>). After the co-transfection, CCK-8 assays revealed that siLRP6 could reverse the effects of poorly expressed miR-346 on JEG-3 cell activity, whereas LRP6 could reverse the inhibitory effect of overexpressed miR-346 on HTR8/SVneo cell activity (<xref rid="f8-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A and B</xref>). Furthermore, the experimental images and quantitative analysis from wound healing and Transwell experiments indicated that siLRP6 suppressed the effects of poorly expressed miR-346 on cell migration and invasion, whereas LRP6 overexpression relieved the inhibitory effects of overexpressed miR-346 on cell migration and invasion (P&#x0003c;0.05; <xref rid="f8-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C-J</xref>). In addition, the expression levels of LRP6 were significantly downregulated in HTR8/SVneo cells that were transfected with miR-346 mimics (P&#x0003c;0.05; <xref rid="f9-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Embryo implantation, which is one of the decisive factors for a successful pregnancy, refers to the process of the embryo gradually burying itself in the endometrial epithelium after entering the uterine cavity, and the invasion of trophoblast cells has a crucially important role during the process (<xref rid="b13-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Trophoblast cells are the main cell type in placental tissues, and abnormal migration and invasion abilities of the cells leads to the occurrence of PE, gestational choriocarcinoma and/or other related diseases (<xref rid="b14-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the present study, it has been shown that LRP6 was suppressed in PE tissues and different trophoblast cell lines, although it was expressed at relatively high levels in gestational choriocarcinoma cells. In a previously published study, Wang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b16-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) demonstrated that downregulated LRP6 could inhibit the growth, invasion and migration of retinoblastoma cells, findings that were similar to the results in the current study. Oppositely to the effect of downregulated LRP6, the present study has also demonstrated that overexpressing LRP6 can measurably promote cell activity and enhance the migration distance and the invasion rate of trophoblast cells, suggesting that upregulated LRP6 may slow down the progression of PE. As for the role of LRP6 in other diseases, Mao <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b17-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) demonstrated that LRP6 was upregulated in human triple negative breast cancer cell lines, and the metastatic ability of the cancer cells was increased via the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin protein signaling pathway. LRP6 was also found to promote metastasis and invasion of colorectal cancer through cytoskeleton dynamics (<xref rid="b18-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). These findings further confirmed the role exerted by LRP6 overexpression in terms of promoting cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and therefore LRP6 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating trophoblast-cell-associated diseases.</p><p>Degradation of the extracellular matrix by members of the MMP family is a critical process in cell migration and invasion (<xref rid="b19-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). TIMPs are a type of tissue inhibitor of metal-loproteinases with multiple physiological functions, and they are able to bind with MMPs noncovalently to maintain the activity of MMPs, and to participate in the maintenance and stability of extracellular matrix components (<xref rid="b20-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). On the one hand, MMP-2 and MMP-9 degrade the extracellular matrix, allowing trophoblast cells to continuously invade the endometrium with the gradual formation of chorion, which eventually allows trophoblast cells to penetrate the decidua and blood vessels during placental formation (<xref rid="b21-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). On the other hand, specific binding of TIMP-1 to MMP-9, and of TIMP-2 to MMP-2, inhibits the invasion of MMPs, so that the invasive behavior and proliferation of trophoblast cells can be properly controlled, thereby leading to the maintenance of moderate levels of cell invasion (<xref rid="b23-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The present study has shown that overexpression of LRP6 not only promoted the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, but also inhibited the secretion of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, in trophoblast cells, whereas transfection with siLRP6 led to entirely the opposite effects on gestational choriocarcinoma cells. These results suggest that the upregulation of LRP6 may control cell migration and invasion by regulating the expression levels of MMPs and TIMPs, thereby alleviating the conditions of PE and gestational choriocarcinoma.</p><p>miRNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in embryo implantation through regulating target genes (<xref rid="b24-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). miRNAs control the expression of target genes, and 60% of them are predicted to be regulators of protein-encoding genes in humans (<xref rid="b26-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Our study demonstrated that miR-346 is able to target and negatively regulate the expression of LRP6, suggesting that upregulated miR-346 inhibited LRP6 expression. Moreover, miR-346 was highly expressed in tissues and trophoblast cell lines; the gestational choriocarcinoma cell line JEG-3 served as a control. LRP6 is known to promote metastasis in numerous types of cancer; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of its role in trophoblasts. Therefore, JEG-3 cells were selected as a control group to study the effect of LRP6 on the normal trophoblast cell line B6Tert-1. In addition, the current study has demonstrated that overexpressed miR-346 is able to suppress the proliferation, migration and invasion of tropho-blast cells and JEG-3 cell, a finding that was reversed by LRP6. Similarly, the downregulation of miR-346 led to an activation of the proliferation, migration and invasion of gestational choriocarcinoma cells, and this phenomenon was also be reversed by siLRP6 treatment. miR-346 is known to have a tumor-promoter function in a variety of tumor cells, including in liver cancer (<xref rid="b27-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), nasopharyngeal cancer (<xref rid="b28-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), and breast cancer (<xref rid="b29-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). However, contrary to previous findings, the present study revealed that downregulated miR-346 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of trophoblast cells. It was speculated that miR-346 might have cell-specific effects; therefore, miR-346 may have different effects on various cell types. In addition, miR-346 inhibited migration and invasion of HTR8/SVneo cells. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that miR-346 was involved in the proliferation, migration and invasion of the trophoblast cells, suggesting that miR-346 may also have a critical role in PE and gestational choriocarcinoma.</p><p>Furthermore, Su <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b30-ijmm-46-01-0211" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) reported that miR-346 regulated endocrine gland-vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF)-induced trophoblast invasion by inhibiting MMP-2 and MMP-9, although it had only a limited effect on TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Consistently in the present study, it was found that the effect of downregulated miR-346 on invasion-associated enzymes was similar to that of upregulated LRP6, which was found to promote the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and to inhibit the expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. Taken together, these results suggested that the effects of miR-346 on cell migration and invasion are mainly realized by regulating the expression of MMPs and inhibiting TIMPs.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that LRP6 is downregulated in patients with PE, whereas the upregulation of LRP6 promoted the proliferation and migration of trophoblast cells, which is opposite to the effect of downregulated LRP6 in gestational choriocarcinoma cells. Moreover, LRP6 has been shown to be involved in the occurrence of PE and gestational choriocarcinoma through regulating the activity, migratory and invasive abilities of cancer cells through miR-346, suggesting that LRP6 might be a possible therapeutic target for the treatment of PE and gestational choriocarcinoma, and that a putative therapy involving LRP6 treatment may decelerate the disease process. However, the effect of miR-346 on the invasion and proliferation of trophoblast cells will be further confirmed in our future studies. In addition, the expression of LRP6 in tissues of patients with choriocarcinoma needs to be investigated further. Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiments should also help in subsequent investigations of the expression levels of LRP6, and its effects, in animals.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="other"><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was received.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LZ made the most substantial contributions to the paper in terms of its conception and design of the experiments; HL, ML, WZ, ZY, and SZ were involved with data acquisition, data analysis and interpretation; and LZ was responsible for drafting the article and critically revising it for important intellectual content.
