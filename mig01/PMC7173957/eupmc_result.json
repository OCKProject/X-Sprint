    "Background:This study aimed to investigate the regulatory role of lncRNA-NEAT1 on cervical cancer (CC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods:The expression of lncRNA-NEAT1 and miR-124 was detected in CC tissues and cells (HeLa and SiHa cells) by qRT-RCR. The relation between lncRNA-NEAT1 expression and clinical parameters of CC patients was explored. The cell migration and invasion were detected by wound healing assay and transwell assay. The cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 and anchorage-independent colony assay. The targeting relation between miR-124 and lncRNA-NEAT1 was predicted by TargetScan and identified by dual luciferase reporter gene and RNA pull-down assay. The expression of metastasis- (MMP-2 and MMP), EMT- (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin), and NF-κB pathway-related factors (NF-κB p65, p-NF-κB p65 and IκBα) was detected by Western blot. Results:The expression of lncRNA-NEAT1 was upregulated in CC tissues and cells and positively correlated with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of lncRNA-NEAT1 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion, influenced the expression of EMT markers, and activated NF-κB pathway in HeLa and SiHa cells. Silencing of lncRNA-NEAT1 exhibited opposite effects on HeLa and SiHa cells. LncRNA-NEAT1 could negatively regulate its target miR-124. MiR-124 reversed the effects of lncRNA-NEAT1 on the migration, invasion, EMT and NF-κB pathway of HeLa cells. Conclusion:LncRNA-NEAT1 promoted the migration and invasion of CC cells via regulating miR-124/NF-κB pathway."
