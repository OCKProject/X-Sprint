Introduction</div> <p>As a chronic progressive inflammatory disease, atherosclerosis is one of the most important types of arteriosclerotic vascular diseases, characterized by subendothelial lipoprotein retention and endothelial injury in the arterial wall [<a href="#B1">1</a>,<a href="#B2">2</a>]. Atherosclerosis is usually responsible for various cardiac–cerebral vascular disease and peripheral vascular disease, with high rates of disability and mortality [<a href="#B1">1</a>,<a href="#B3">3</a>]. Although the drug treatments for atherosclerosis have the intensive progress, unsatisfactory adverse effects such as liver injury and myopathy still exist [<a href="#B4">4</a>]. Thus, it is essential to search for novel treatment methods of atherosclerosis.</p> <p>It is well known that the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is very complex [<a href="#B5">5</a>]. The initial inflammatory damage of endothelial cells leads to the permeability of lipid-increasing proteins and the adhesion of leukocytes, and then adhere leukocytes to swallow oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and turn into foam cells. Subsequently, foam cells produce a large number of inflammatory chemokines and increase the adhesion of leukocytes, thereby promoting inflammatory response and the formation of atherosclerotic plaque [<a href="#B5">5</a>]. Aberrant proliferation, apoptosis and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have been proved to be implicated with the occurrence and progression of atherosclerotic plaques despite of the complex pathogenesis [<a href="#B6">6</a>,<a href="#B7">7</a>]. VSMCs are the main constituent cells of the blood vessel wall, and play a crucial role in regulating vascular function [<a href="#B8">8</a>]. Notably, as an adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is reported to play critical role in the progression of atherosclerosis by mediating inflammatory response, and it has been considered as an effect target against atherosclerosis [<a href="#B9">9–11</a>]. Moreover, previous studies also have demonstrated that the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) can not only inhibit the migration of VSMCs in plaques, but also inhibit apoptosis of VSMCs induced by ox-LDL, which indicate that PPARδ agonist may be a potential treatment for atherosclerosis [<a href="#B12">12</a>,<a href="#B13">13</a>].</p> <p>Currently, nanomicelles (NMs) are reported to be a promising drug delivery system, and widely applied in disease therapy [<a href="#B14">14</a>]. As the most common nanocarriers, NMs possess several favorable properties (such as high biocompatibility and ability) to carry large drug payloads [<a href="#B14">14</a>]. Previous studies have developed drug-loaded NMs, which exhibit improved effects compared with free drug [<a href="#B15">15–17</a>]. Therefore, in the current research, we prepared the VCAM-1-targeted and GW0742 (PPARδ agonist)-loaded NMs, and then characterization and <i>in vitro</i> drug release of NMs were detected. In addition, the effects of NMs on apoptosis and migration of VSMCs were unraveled.</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Materials and methods</div> <div class="preparationofnms" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Preparation of NMs</div> <p>Briefly, 2 mg of GW0742 (MedChemExpress, NJ, U.S.A.) was dissolved in 1 ml of absolute methanol, en mixed with 80 μg of Cy5.5 and 10 mg of PEG2000-DSPE that were dissolved in 3 ml of chloroform. Next, the mixture was transferred into the eggplant-shaped bottle. After removing the organic solvent through a vacuum rotary evaporator, a dry lipid film was formed on the bottom of the bottle, and then dissolved in 2 ml of phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) buffer and hydrated in a water bath at 60°C for 30 min. The hydrated solution was filtered through polycarbonate membrane (0.2 μm pore size) to remove unencapsulated hydrophobic molecules, thereby obtaining a GW0742-loaded NMs (M-GW) solution. Similarly, targeted M-GW (TM-GW) were prepared as described above, except that PEG2000-DSPE was replaced by anti-VCAM-1 modified-PEG2000-DSPE (provided by Ruixi Bio Co. Ltd, Xi’an, China).</p> </div> <div class="characterizationofnms" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Characterization of NMs</div> <p>The morphological characteristics and particle size parameters of TM-GW were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Briefly, the NMs solution was diluted with deionized water at 0.25 mg/ml with deionized water, and then 10 μl of the sample was dripped on to a carbon-coated copper mesh. After water evaporation, the sample was counterstained with 5 μl of 1% uranyl acetate solution for 30 s, and dried by a 42°C constant temperature dryer. Finally, the sample was observed by TEM (Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN, FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands). DLS was performed by Zetasizer Nano Z (Worcestershire, U.K.).</p> </div> <div class="invitrodrugreleaseanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title"><i>In vitro</i> drug release analysis</div> <p>The drug release profiles of M-GW and TM-GW at different pH values were analyzed. In brief, 200 μl of M-GW and TM-GW were separately loaded into a dialysis bag (molecular retention of 8000–12000 Da), and the dialysis bag was immersed in 35 ml of PBS buffer (pH 7.4 and 5.0, respectively). PBS buffer with pH 7.4 was used to simulate blood plasma environment and that with pH 5.0 late tumor endocytic compartment. The entire dialysis system was shaken at 200 rpm in a constant temperature shaker at 37°C in the dark. Subsequently, 1 ml of dialysate was taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 24 h, respectively. Finally, the concentration of GW0742 in the dialysate was determined by fluorescence spectrophotometer, and the <i>in vitro</i> release profile was calculated.</p> </div> <div class="cellcultureandtreatment" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Cell culture and treatment</div> <p>Human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (HAVSMCs) were provided by Shanghai Obio (China), and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) under 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Characterization and <i>in vitro</i> drug release of M-GW and TM-GW</div> <p>As shown in <a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>A, TEM showed spherical shape of TM-GW with the size of 50–90 nm (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>A). Accordingly, DLS revealed that the hydrodynamic diameter of TM-GW was observed to be approximately 70 nm (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>B). Next, the amounts of GW0742 released from M-GW and TM-GW were examined at pH 7.4 and pH 5.0. Cumulative drug release profiles revealed that both M-GW and TM-GW exhibited a burst release of GW0742 within 5 h and a slow release from 5 to 24 h at pH 7.4 and 5.0 (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>C). Notably, almost 80% of GW0742 was released from both M-GW and TM-GW within 24 h at pH 5.0, which was significantly higher than that at pH 7.4 (<a href="#F1">Figure 1</a>C).</p> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Discussion</div> <p>It is well known that VSMCs play important roles in the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques, and increasing studies have reported that targeting VSMCs is suggested to be a critical strategy to alleviate atherosclerosis [<a href="#B6">6</a>]. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effect of PPARδ agonist GW0742 on ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs. PPARδ as a member of PPAR family has been considered to exert important roles in cellular inflammatory responses and lipid homeostasis [<a href="#B18">18</a>]. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that PPARδ agonists such as GW0742 and GW1516 can prevent the progression of atherosclerosis through regulating inflammatory response [<a href="#B19">19–21</a>]. However, due to poor water solubility, GW0742 may be clinically limited to apply into disease treatment. NMs have been reported to be a promising drug delivery system to overcome the application limitation of hydrophobic drugs because of its attractive properties, including highly hydrophilic nature and excellent biocompatibility [<a href="#B22">22</a>,<a href="#B23">23</a>]. Thus, the present study developed M-GWs, and evaluated the effect of M-GWs on ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs.</p> <p>The present study revealed that ox-LDL treatment significantly increased cell migration and apoptosis of HAVSMCs; however, free GW0742 treatment inhibited cell migration and apoptosis in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs, and then M-GW further diminished cell migration and apoptosis in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs compared with free GW0742. In addition, the present study detected the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, and the results found that M-GW remarkably decreased the protein concentrations of MMP2 and MMP9. Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are important members of the MMP family, and are also implicated with cell migration by medicating inflammatory cell infiltration in atherosclerosis [<a href="#B24">24</a>]. Moreover, the concentrations of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bim, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, were measured. Bim, Bad, Bax and Bcl-2 belong to Bcl-2 protein family, which exert significant role in cell apoptosis, and Bim, Bad and Bax are pro-apoptosis proteins, while Bcl-2 is anti-apoptosis protein [<a href="#B25">25</a>]. It is well known that Bcl-2 protein family is closely associated with mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway [<a href="#B26">26</a>]. As a downstream molecule of apoptosis pathway, caspase-3 can inhibit the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and then contribute to cell apoptosis [<a href="#B26">26</a>]. In addition, caspase-3 also can be activated followed by the recruitment and activation of caspase-9 [<a href="#B27">27</a>]. Notably, we found that ox-LDL treatment significantly decreased protein concentrations of P-FAK and TGF-β1 in HAVSMCs; however, free GW0742 treatment increased their expression in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs, and then M-GW further promoted the expression of P-FAK and TGF-β1 in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs compared with free GW0742. Both the activations of FAK and TGF-β1 have been proved to be implicated in cell apoptosis and migration [<a href="#B28">28</a>,<a href="#B29">29</a>]. Thus, we speculated that FAK/TGF-β1 signaling pathway participated in the effects of M-GW on cell apoptosis and migration in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs.</p> <p>Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of M-GW targeting to HAVSMCs, anti-VCAM-1 modified M-GW (TM-GW) was prepared. The presentstudy found that VCAM-1 was over-xpressed in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs, and TM-GW exhibited increased the cellular uptake than M-GW. Previous study has demonstrated that targeting VCAM-1 with nanoparticles can be effectively utilized in the treatment of atherosclerosis [<a href="#B30">30</a>]. Similarly, the present study revealed that TM-GW exhibited enhanced inhibiting effects on cell apoptosis and migration compared with M-GW in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs.</p> <p>In conclusion, the present study successfully developed that M-GW and TM-GW, and TM-GW hL by inhibiting VCAM-1 and PPARδ. Overall, TM-GW might be a promising therapeutic nanomedicine in atherosclerosis; however, the further <i>in vivo</i> experiments should be investigated.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="COI-statement" title="COI-statement"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
