Atherosclerosis is usually responsible for various cardiac&#x02013;cerebral vascular disease and peripheral vascular disease, with high rates of disability and mortality [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although the drug treatments for atherosclerosis have the intensive progress, unsatisfactory adverse effects such as liver injury and myopathy still exist [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, it is essential to search for novel treatment methods of atherosclerosis.</p><p>It is well known that the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is very complex [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The initial inflammatory damage of endothelial cells leads to the permeability of lipid-increasing proteins and the adhesion of leukocytes, and then adhere leukocytes to swallow oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and turn into foam cells. Subsequently, foam cells produce a large number of inflammatory chemokines and increase the adhesion of leukocytes, thereby promoting inflammatory response and the formation of atherosclerotic plaque [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Aberrant proliferation, apoptosis and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have been proved to be implicated with the occurrence and progression of atherosclerotic plaques despite of the complex pathogenesis [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. VSMCs are the main constituent cells of the blood vessel wall, and play a crucial role in regulating vascular function [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Notably, as an adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is reported to play critical role in the progression of atherosclerosis by mediating inflammatory response, and it has been considered as an effect target against atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies also have demonstrated that the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b4; (PPAR&#x003b4;) can not only inhibit the migration of VSMCs in plaques, but also inhibit apoptosis of VSMCs induced by ox-LDL, which indicate that PPAR&#x003b4; agonist may be a potential treatment for atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Currently, nanomicelles (NMs) are reported to be a promising drug delivery system, and widely applied in disease therapy [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As the most common nanocarriers, NMs possess several favorable properties (such as high biocompatibility and ability) to carry large drug payloads [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Previous studies have developed drug-loaded NMs, which exhibit improved effects compared with free drug [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref>]. Therefore, in the current research, we prepared the VCAM-1-targeted and GW0742 (PPAR&#x003b4; agonist)-loaded NMs, and then characterization and <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release of NMs were detected.

The hydrated solution was filtered through polycarbonate membrane (0.2 &#x003bc;m pore size) to remove unencapsulated hydrophobic molecules, thereby obtaining a GW0742-loaded NMs (M-GW) solution. Similarly, targeted M-GW (TM-GW) were prepared as described above, except that PEG2000-DSPE was replaced by anti-VCAM-1 modified-PEG2000-DSPE (provided by Ruixi Bio Co.

Moreover, compared with cells treated with ox-LDL, the expressions of Bim, Bad, Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were obviously decreased, while the expression of Bcl-2 was remarkably elevated after the addition of free GW0742, M-GW or TM-GW (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C), with the highest difference in HAVSMCs treated with ox-LDL and TM-GW, followed by M-GW and free GW0742 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Furthermore, the expressions of P-FAK and TGF-&#x003b2;1 were detected, and the results showed decreased protein concentrations of P-FAK and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in ox-LDL-treated HAVSMCs compared with control cells, and increased concentrations of P-FAK and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs treated with free GW0742, M-GW and TM-GW, in turn (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D).</p><fig id="F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>TM-GW inhibited cell apoptosis in ox-LDL (60 &#x003bc;g/ml)-treated HAVSMCs</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell apoptosis rate of HAVSMCs treated with PBS (control), ox-LDL, ox-LDL + GW0742, ox-LDL + M-GW, or ox-LDL + TM-GW using AO/EB staining kit.

Thus, in the present study, we investigated the effect of PPAR&#x003b4; agonist GW0742 on ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs. PPAR&#x003b4; as a member of PPAR family has been considered to exert important roles in cellular inflammatory responses and lipid homeostasis [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that PPAR&#x003b4; agonists such as GW0742 and GW1516 can prevent the progression of atherosclerosis through regulating inflammatory response [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref>]. However, due to poor water solubility, GW0742 may be clinically limited to apply into disease treatment. NMs have been reported to be a promising drug delivery system to overcome the application limitation of hydrophobic drugs because of its attractive properties, including highly hydrophilic nature and excellent biocompatibility [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the present study developed M-GWs, and evaluated the effect of M-GWs on ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs.</p><p>The present study revealed that ox-LDL treatment significantly increased cell migration and apoptosis of HAVSMCs; however, free GW0742 treatment inhibited cell migration and apoptosis in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs, and then M-GW further diminished cell migration and apoptosis in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs compared with free GW0742. In addition, the present study detected the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, and the results found that M-GW remarkably decreased the protein concentrations of MMP2 and MMP9. Both MMP-2 and MMP-9 are important members of the MMP family, and are also implicated with cell migration by medicating inflammatory cell infiltration in atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Moreover, the concentrations of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bim, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, were measured. Bim, Bad, Bax and Bcl-2 belong to Bcl-2 protein family, which exert significant role in cell apoptosis, and Bim, Bad and Bax are pro-apoptosis proteins, while Bcl-2 is anti-apoptosis protein [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is well known that Bcl-2 protein family is closely associated with mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As a downstream molecule of apoptosis pathway, caspase-3 can inhibit the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and then contribute to cell apoptosis [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, caspase-3 also can be activated followed by the recruitment and activation of caspase-9 [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Notably, we found that ox-LDL treatment significantly decreased protein concentrations of P-FAK and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in HAVSMCs; however, free GW0742 treatment increased their expression in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs, and then M-GW further promoted the expression of P-FAK and TGF-&#x003b2;1 in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs compared with free GW0742. Both the activations of FAK and TGF-&#x003b2;1 have been proved to be implicated in cell apoptosis and migration [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, we speculated that FAK/TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling pathway participated in the effects of M-GW on cell apoptosis and migration in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs.</p><p>Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy of M-GW targeting to HAVSMCs, anti-VCAM-1 modified M-GW (TM-GW) was prepared. The presentstudy found that VCAM-1 was over-xpressed in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs, and TM-GW exhibited increased the cellular uptake than M-GW. Previous study has demonstrated that targeting VCAM-1 with nanoparticles can be effectively utilized in the treatment of atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similarly, the present study revealed that TM-GW exhibited enhanced inhibiting effects on cell apoptosis and migration compared with M-GW in ox-LDL-induced HAVSMCs.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study successfully developed that M-GW and TM-GW, and TM-GW hL by inhibiting VCAM-1 and PPAR&#x003b4;. Overall, TM-GW might be a promising therapeutic nanomedicine in atherosclerosis; however, the further <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments should be investigated.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there are no competing interests associated with the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec6" sec-type="funding"><title>Funding</title><p>The authors declare that there are no sources of funding to be acknowledged.</p></sec><sec id="sec7" sec-type="author-contrib"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>Gang Wei and Qian Peng performed the majority of experiments and analyzed the data.
