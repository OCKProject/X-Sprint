    "BACKGROUND Mitophagy, a selective autophagy process, plays various roles in tumors. Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) is an inner-mitochondrial membrane protein that participates in parkin-induced mitophagy. However, the role of PHB2 in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has not been previously reported. MATERIAL AND METHODS PHB2 protein or PHB2-mRNA in NSCLC and paired normal tissues was determined by Western blot, qRT-PCR, and immunohistochemical staining. Cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration was evaluated by wound healing and transwell migration assays. A 3D live-cell confocal system was used to monitor autophagic flux. Mitochondrial autolysosomes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Finally, we performed JC-1 assay to measure mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). RESULTS The level of PHB2 was significantly increased in human NSCLC specimens compared to paired adjacent specimens. Inhibition of PHB2 expression attenuated mitophagy in A549 and H1299 cells, as indicated by decreased levels of LC3 II/I and parkin markers and increased level of p62 protein. Furthermore, the inhibition caused reduction in mitochondrial autolysosomes and autophagic flux, as shown by TEM and live-cell imaging, respectively. In addition, PHB2 inhibition caused a remarkable increase in MMP and suppressed the proliferation and migration of A549 and H1299 cells. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that downregulation of PHB2 reduced parkin-mediated mitophagy, which suppressed proliferation and migration of A549 and H1299 cells."
