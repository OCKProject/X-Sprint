In the last several years, more and more studies have demonstrated the significant roles played by circular RNAs (circRNAs) in different human tumors progression including NSCLC. The present study was to explore the mechanism of hsa_circ_101237 in regulating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Totally 303 NSCLC cases were enrolled. A549 and H1299 cells were transfected. Cells viability, migration and invasion were determined by CCK-8 assay and transwell experiment, respectively. Luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were performed. hsa_circ_101237, miR-490-3p and MAPK1 expression in tissues/cells were detected by qRT-PCR. The study found an elevation in the expression of Hsa_circRNA_101237 in both NSCLC tissues and cell line. High Hsa_circRNA_101237 expression predicted poor survival in NSCLC. Meanwhile, we found that hsa_circRNA_101237 expression sponged miR-490-3p to enhance MAPK1 expression, thus significantly promoting NSCLC cell lines proliferation, migration, and invasion. MAPK1 restoration prevented NSCLC cells proliferation, migration, and invasion to be repressed due to hsa_circRNA_101237 knockdown. To sum up, as revealed by the study, hsa_circRNA_101237 promoted the expression of MAPK1 via miRNA-490-3p sponge, thus affecting the NSCLC as an important onco-circRNA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer genetics</kwd><kwd>Cell invasion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Lung cancer, characterized by a poor prognosis but a high morbidity, is a common malignant tumor, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are identified as the most common type of lung cancer (occupying about 85%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Due to the feature, circRNAs exhibit a lot of properties, and many properties were found not long ago. circRNAs have a special closed loop structure, making them able to resist the degradation medicated by exonuclease. On that account, they are more stable compared with most other linear RNAs, thus they can be used as a biomarker to effectively diagnose and treat cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. circRNAs can interact with RNA-binding proteins, so as to regulate target gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Besides, it has been indicated that circRNAs can be sinks for miRNAs, to control the function processed by miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Many human cancers see altered circRNA expression, and many researches have revealed the key role played by circRNAs in the tumorigenesis. circRNA_101237, a new circRNA identified recently, whose encoding gene is located at chromosome (chr) 13:26974589-26975761 and which is produced by backsplicing of exons 10, 11 and 12 of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 8, has been reported to be implicated in Cisplatin resistance-associated of HCC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

For figuring out if hsa_circ_101237 could be a ceRNA, its subcellular localization was firstly detected. Nuclear/cytoplasmic fraction assay results showed that, most hsa_circ_101237 presented a preferential localization in cytoplasm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Therefore, it was assumed that hsa_circ_101237 could be a ceRNA. Under the predication of bioinformatics analyses, it is possible for complementary base in miR-490-3p ranked the top to act as a direct target of hsa_circ_101237 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Besides, as verified by assays, wild-type hsa_circ_101237 greatly hindered the luciferase activity exhibited by miR-490-3p instead of the mutant form (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C,D</xref>).

Meanwhile, miR-490-3p expression remarkably decreased in A549 cells and H1299cells comparison with MRC-5 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1A</xref>). Additionally, expression of miR-490-3p was lower in NSCLC tissues compared with non-tumor tissues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). The expression of miR-490-3p and hsa_circ_101237 in NSCLC tissues exhibited a negative correlation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>, R&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.456, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Above data demonstrated that as a competing endogenous RNA, hsa_circ_101237 could interact with miR-490-3p, thus inhibiting their action. Rescue experiments were used to further elucidate whether the activities of hsa_circ_101237 in NSCLC cells were mediated by the miR-490-3p. First, si-hsa_circ_101237 was co-transfected with miR-490-3p inhibitor into NSCLC cells, and cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were examined.
