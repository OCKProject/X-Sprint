Abstract</div> <p>Hypoxia, reduced vascularization, elevated oxidative stress, and infection are critical clinical hallmarks of non-healing chronic diabetic wounds. The dataset presented here is in support of the development and evaluation of the exosome laden oxygen releasing OxOBand for treatment and management of diabetic and infectious wounds <a href="#bib0001">[1]</a>. It describes the additional results in support of the development of OxOBand and its evaluation for diabetic wound healing. Exosomes were isolated from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and characterized through dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The encapsulation of exosomes by cells and its effect on migration of NIH3T3 cells under in-vitro condition is described. Further antioxidant polyurethane (PUAO) cryogel and oxygen releasing antioxidant (PUAO-CPO) cryogel scaffolds were fabricated as reported earlier [<a href="#bib0002">2</a>,<a href="#bib0003">3</a>] and NIH3T3, HaCaT and ADSCs were cultured on these scaffolds. "OxOBand", the calcium peroxide containing oxygen releasing antioxidant polyurethane (PUAO-CPO) scaffold along with exosomes was evaluated in chronic wounds in diabetic rats. The wounds were also infected with <i>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)</i> bacteria and OxOBand was further evaluated for the healing of these infectious diabetic wounds. Interpretation of this data can be found in a research article title "Exosome laden oxygen releasing antioxidant and antibacterial cryogel wound dressing OxOBand alleviate diabetic and infectious wound healing, Shiekh et. al., Biomaterials, 2020 <a href="#bib0001">[1]</a>.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Experimental Design, Materials, and Methods</div> <p id="para0007">Here, we describe the characterisation of exosomes isolated from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). The isolated exosomes were evaluated for their cellular encapsulation, and effect on cellular migration.

Characterisation of exosomes</div> <p id="para0008">Exosomes were characterised for size distribution through dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. Briefly, exosome samples were diluted in millQ water and filtered through 0.22 µm filter, loaded into the cuvette and readings were obtained using Zetasizer (Malvern Panalytical Ltd, NL). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out for morphological analysis of the exosomes. For SEM analysis, exosomes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), washed with milliQ water and dried in a desiccator before imaging. The images were obtained at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV using FEI-Quanta 200. For TEM analysis, exosomes were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, counterstained with 1% uranyl acetate, and imaged at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV using FEI-Tecnai G2.</p> </div> <div class="exosomeuptakeandinternalisation" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.2</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Internalisation of intact exosomes was studied in HaCaT cells by labelling them with Calcein AM stain. Calcein AM is a membrane permeable dye, which shows fluorescence once inside the exosomes due to esterase activity. The images were acquired using confocal microscopy (Leica SPE II, Germany). Uptake was also studied in NIH3T3 cells by labelling exosomes with PKH26 dye (Sigma Aldrich, USA).

Cell migration in presence of exosomes</div> <p id="para0010">The effect of ADSCs derived exosomes on cellular migration was studied in NIH3T3 fibroblast cells. Cells were cultured in a 24 well tissue culture plate for 24 h. To reduce the cell proliferation, cells were serum-starved overnight. A micro scratch in the cell layer was made at the centre of 24 wells plate, cell debris was washed and treated with exosomes at a concentration of 20 µg/ml. Cells without any exosome treatment were taken as control. The migration was monitored for 24 h and images were acquired at different time intervals. From the acquired images, wound closure percentage was calculated through ImageJ software. The area of the wound remaining at each time interval was calculated and normalised with the area just after scratch. From the wound area, the migration rate was calculated by dividing the area of migration by time elapsed. For live-cell imaging and visualisation, cells were also stained with Calcein AM dye and imaged at different time intervals.</p> </div> <div class="cellculturestudiesonpuaoandpuao-cpocryogelscaffolds" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.4</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Cell culture studies on PUAO and PUAO-CPO cryogel scaffolds</div> <p id="para0011">For cell culture studies, PUAO and PUAO-CPO scaffolds were sterilised using gradient ethanol. Briefly, cryogels were washed with 70% ethanol for 1 h, followed by 100% ethanol under UV light for 1 h. The cryogel scaffolds were further washed three times with 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and incubated in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) overnight. Next day, cells were trypsinized and counted using a haemocytometer. On each scaffold, 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were seeded in 20 µl DMEM and incubated for 4 h for cell attachment in a 48 well plate. After 4 h, 200 µl of media containing 10% FBS was added. HaCaT, NIH3T3 and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were cultured on PUAO and PUAO-CPO cryogel scaffolds. Cells cultured on tissue culture plate (TCP) were used as control. Metabolic activity was assayed using MTT assay at different time intervals. Briefly, media was aspirated from the wells and 200 µl of MTT was added. After 4 h incubation at 37°C, MTT was aspirated and the formazan crystals formed were dissolved in DMSO by incubation at 37°C for 15 min. Metabolic activity was determined by measuring absorbance at 570 nm in a microplate reader (BioTek, USA). All values were normalized with day 0 and represented as mean ± s.d.</p> </div> <div class="collagenremodellingbypicrosiriusredstaining" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.5</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Collagen remodelling by picrosirius red staining</div> <p id="para0012">For collagen remodelling analysis, animal tissues were stained with picrosirius red. Briefly animal tissues after harvesting were fixed in 10% formalin in PBS for 72 h. The fixed tissues were dehydrated in gradient ethanol, embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned into 5 µm sections using microtome (Leica, Germany) and collected on super frost slides coated with poly-L-lysine. The sections were stained with picrosirius red stain and imaged under polarised light microscopy using Leica DM 2500 microscope. The remodelling of collagen was analysed by ImageJ software.</p> </div> <div class="infectionstudiesindiabeticwounds" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.6</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Infection studies in diabetic wounds</div> <p id="para0013">For infection studies in diabetic wounds, the diabetic wounds were infected with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>), and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) in a ratio of 1:1. Briefly, diabetes was induced in rats by feeding with high fat diet followed by intraperitoneal injection of two alternate doses of streptozocin (30 mg/kg body weight). Four weeks after diabetic induction, animals with glucose level above 250 mg/dl were used for further experimentation. Two 8 mm wounds were created at the back of rat and inoculated with 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>), and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>P. aeruginosa</i>) in a ratio of 1:1. Three days after ulcer formation, bacterial swabs were collected using q tip and cultured in specific media for <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (S. aureus), and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (P. aeruginosa) to calculate CFUs. The wounds were treated with PUAO-CPO scaffolds along with exosomes for 21 days. Bacterial CFUs were also calculated after 21 days of treatment to analyse control in infection.</p> </div> <div class="statisticalanalysis" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.7</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
