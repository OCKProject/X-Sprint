In our study, we showed that LINC00173 is overexpressed in CRC tissues and predicted poor prognosis. LINC00173 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion and increased the sensitivity of CRC cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Moreover, LINC00173 knockdown inhibited CRC growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that LINC00173 targeted miR-765/PLP2 axis.

We first measured the expression of PLP2 to confirm the success of transfection (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). CCK8 assay showed that LINC00173 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 and SW480 cells while miR-765 inhibitors reversed it (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, PLP2 knockdown further inhibited the proliferation of CRC cells transfected with sh-LINC00173 plus miR-765 inhibitors (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), which was further validated by EdU assay (<xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Then, wound-healing assay was performed to test migration.

CRC leads to a large number of cancer-related deaths worldwide.<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is very urgent and important to understand the molecular mechanism of CRC development. Herein, we found that LINC00173 expression was upregulated in CRC tissues and cells. And LINC00173 is a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC patients. We showed that LINC00173 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we also demonstrated that LINC00173 knockdown sensitized CRC cells to 5-FU treatment. Thus, LINC00173 may be a potential target for CRC therapy.</p><p>In recent years, increasing researches have demonstrated that lncRNAs participate in the regulation of tumor development and progression, including CRC.<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> For example, lncRNA LINC00483 contributes to growth and invasion of CRC through regulating FMNL2 expression.<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> LncRNA kcna3 is a negative regulator of CRC progression via inhibiting YAP11 expression.<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Previously, LINC00173 was reported to promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of lung cancer cells.<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Recently, a study indicates that LINC00173contributes to breast cancer progression.<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, its roles in CRC are unclear. In our work, LINC00173 silencing repressed growth and metastasis of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we also revealed that LINC00173 affected the resistance of CRC cells to 5-FU. Our study demonstrated that LINC00173 is a crucial oncogene in CRC.</p><p>Subsequently, we identified that miR-765 is a potential target of LINC00173 through bioinformatics, which was confirmed by luciferase reporter assay. MiR-765 may act as anti-tumor roles or oncogenic functions in different cancer cells.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> For instance, miR-765 inhibits development of clear cell renal cell cancer via suppressing PLP2 expression.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> MiR-765 accelerates growth of liver cancer cells via inhibiting INPP4B expression.<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Its function in CRC remains to be defined. We performed a lot of assays, such as CCK8 assay, EdU assay and Transwell assay. We found that miR-765 inhibitors reversed the effects of LINC00173 knockdown. Our findings support that miR-765 is a suppressor in CRC.</p><p>Afterwards, PLP2 was predicted to be targeted by miR-765. We also used luciferase reporter assay to confirm the interaction between miR-765 and PLP2. Our finding is consistent with a previous report in clear cell renal cell cancer.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> PLP2 has been reported to be involved in several cancers as oncogene.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For example, PLP2 overexpression promotes the development of cutaneous malignant melanoma.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> PLP2 upregulation promotes proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma.<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Besides, LP2 is also involved in promoting breast cancer cell stemness.<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> How it functions in CRC is still elusive. In our study, we showed that PLP2 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells. Our results demonstrated that PLP2 promotes CRC development.</p><p>In summary, the current work identified that LINC00173 silencing attenuated growth, metastasis and chemo-resistance of CRC cells through sponging miR-765 from PLP2 mRNA. Our study suggests that LINC00173/miR-765/PLP2 axis may be a potential target for CRC therapy. Nevertheless, there are some limitations in the current study. For instance, more CRC samples are required to determine association between LINC00173 expression and clinical features. Whether LINC00173 could be a diagnostic biomarker is not defined.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0005" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Disclosure</title><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Jemal</surname>
