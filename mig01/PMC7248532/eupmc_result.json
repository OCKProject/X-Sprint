    "The present study aimed to investigate the role of Wiskott‑Aldrich syndrome verprolin‑homologous protein 3 (WAVE3) in the progression of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and to explore its effect on the migration of esophageal cancer cell lines in vitro. The expression level of WAVE3 in ESCC tissues was determined via immunohistochemistry, and the relative levels of WAVE3 mRNA and micro (mi)RNA200b were assessed in the serum of patients with ESCC using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR). Following cell transfection, the levels of miRNA200b and WAVE3 protein were determined via RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis, and cell migration was examined using a Transwell assay. Subsequently, the clinical parameters were used to analyze whether the expression of WAVE3 in tissues and serum was associated with the occurrence and development of ESCC. The results demonstrated that the expression of WAVE3 was increased in ESCC tissues compared with normal tissues. The results also revealed increased expression levels of WAVE3 and decreased expression levels of miRNA200b in the serum of patients with ESCC, compared with healthy volunteers. High expression of WAVE3 was significantly associated with tumor TNM stage, invasion depth and lymphatic invasion of ESCC. In cells transfected with miRNA200b mimic, the miRNA200b was overexpressed, WAVE3 protein was downregulated and cell migration ability was decreased. The results of the present study suggest that WAVE3 may serve as an oncogene in ESCC, and its inhibition via miRNA200b decreased tumor cell migration. Therefore, WAVE3 may serve as a novel biological marker and therapeutic target for ESCC."
