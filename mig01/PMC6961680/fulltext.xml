The genetic differences between breast cancer sub-populations have been used to guide new treatment protocols that have markedly improved patient survival [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. There are now at least 33 gene signatures for breast cancer classification that identify patients at high and low risk of recurrence or patients likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. Amongst some of these signatures is the human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) gene, which encodes a drug metabolizing enzyme widely expression in the body. In breast cancer, NAT1 expression is inversely related to overall survival and predicts response to cytotoxic chemotherapy but not hormonal therapy [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>]. These observations have led several investigators to suggest a role for NAT1 in cell biology independent of its drug metabolizing functions. However, the molecular and cellular effects of NAT1 expression in breast cancer remain to be completely understood.</p><p>Inhibition of NAT1 activity in cancer cells either by siRNA-mediated silencing, small molecular inhibitors or gene deletion with CRISPR/Cas 9 editing results in changes in cell survival and invasion [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Deletion of NAT1 has been associated with epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>], a hallmark of invasive potential [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. Moreover, NAT1 is required for invasion in a mouse model of breast cancer pulmonary metastases [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>] suggesting it may be a druggable target in some cancers. However, survival data in patients suggest a different role for NAT1. In breast cancer, survival is significantly better in those patients with high tumor NAT1 expression compared to those with low tumor NAT1 expression [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>].</p><p>MDA-MB-231 cells are triple-negative breast cancer cells with a spindle-like morphology. These cells lack E-cadherin expression and readily metastasis in animal models suggesting a mesenchymal-like phenotype [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>]. Recently, it was demonstrated that deletion of NAT1 in MDA-MB-231 cells up-regulated MMP expression, in particular MMP9 [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. This change was also seen in the highly invasive estrogen receptor-positive T-47D breast carcinoma cells. Moreover, gene expression in patient tumor samples showed a significant inverse relationship between NAT1 expression and MMP9 expression. The association between MMP expression and cancer cell invasion is well documented and this has been demonstrated for MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Consequently, the up-regulation of MMP9 following NAT1 deletion is not in agreement with the reported decrease in invasion following NAT1 inhibition in these cells [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. However, MDA-MB-231 cells also demonstrate integrin-dependent amoeboid motility in 3-dimensional matrigel invasion assays [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>] and the possible effects of NAT1 on integrins have not been reported. In the present study, the role of MMPs and integrins in MDA-MB-231 cell adherence, migration and invasion following NAT1 deletion was studied using real-time cell motility analysis. This approach provides temporal information about cell motility through different matrices and can be used to monitor changes when MMP and/or integrin function changes. The results may explain the apparent dichotomy between NAT1 deletion, MMP expression and cell invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><p>One characteristic observed while culturing NAT1 KO cells is their ability to adhere to plastic culture dishes and their relative resistance to removal with trypsin suggesting adherence is affected by NAT1 deletion. Cell adherence was therefore measured using two different assays. In the first assay, the rate of adhesion was quantified. MDA-MB-231, HT-29 and HeLa parental and KO cells were added to the xCELLigence RTCA DP analyzer in wells coated with collagen and impedance was measured over 60 min (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1a</xref>). An increase in impedance (cell index) is indicative of increased cell adhesion. For both MDA-MB-231 and HT-29 cells, the parental lines adhered to collagen more rapidly than the NAT1 knockout line. By contrast, no difference was seen in the HeLa cells. The second assay measured the rate of cell detachment from a substrate using trypsin. Cells were cultured on serum-treated polystyrene culture plates over 24 hr, which induces focal adhesion formations between the cells and substrate-bound vitronectin derived from the serum [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. For all three cell-lines, trypsin detached the parental cells more rapidly than the NAT1 knockout cells (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1b</xref>). Taken together, these assays suggest a difference in the adhesion and detachment of cells following NAT1 deletion.<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19336918.2019.1710015-F0001</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The effect of NAT1 deletion on cell adhesion.

The aspect ratio, a measure of cell roundedness, significantly decreased following NAT1 deletion (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2b</xref>).

Similarly in the wound healing assay, there was no difference between the cell-lines. Collectively, these experiments indicated that NAT1 deletion does not affect the ability for MDA-MB-231 cells to migrate.<fig id="F0003" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19336918.2019.1710015-F0003</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Effect of NAT1 deletion on migration in MDA-MB-231 cells.

By contrast, when activity was decreased by 39%, no change in invasion was seen [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. The role of NAT1 in cell invasion <italic>in vitro</italic> was revisited using CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing to ensure complete reduction in NAT1 expression. Similar to previous reports, NAT1 deletion significantly decreased cell invasion (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4a</xref>). Moreover, when NAT1 was rescued, invasion returned to that seen in the parental cells. These experiments were performed using serum as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber of the real-time monitoring apparatus. In the upper chamber, cells were seeded in the absence of serum. Secreted MMPs require serum-derived proteases for activation and the absence of serum could explain why NAT1 deleted cells secrete more MMP9 than parental cells but show attenuated invasion. To test this, secreted MMP1, 3 and 9 were measured by Western blotting (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4b</xref>). Full blots are shown in Supplementary figure. Pro-MMP1 was down-regulated in the NAT1 knockout cells whereas Pro-MMP9 was up-regulated, consistent with previously published results [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. There was no evidence for MMP3 secretion in either cell-line. In addition, there was no evidence that the MMPs were activated in the absence of serum. To cleave the secreted MMPs, plasminogen was added to the cell cultures for 24 hr. Plasminogen is activated to plasmin by urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which is highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. Plasmin is able to activate multiple MMPs [<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>]. Addition of plasminogen resulted in complete activation of MMP1 in the parental cells and partial activation of MMP9 in the knockout cells. Plasminogen also induced MMP3 secretion equally in both cell-lines (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4b</xref>).<fig id="F0004" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19336918.2019.1710015-F0004</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Effect of MMP expression on MDA-MB-231 invasion through matrigel.

Plasminogen slightly increased the invasive capacity of both the parental and NAT1 deleted cells (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4c</xref>). However, it did not overcome the attenuated invasion seen in the knockout cell-line. Finally, because there may be other MMPs involved in MDA-MB-231 invasion, a pan MMP inhibitor (GM6001) was used in the invasion assay (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4d</xref>). There was no difference in invasion of either parental or NAT1 knockout cells following treatment. These results suggest that the MMPs do not contribute significantly to the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells through the matrigel substrate used in this and other studies.</p><p>MMP-independent mechanisms have been proposed for breast cancer cell invasion, including integrin-dependent amoeboid motility. Integrins are also involved in cell adhesion. Expression of the major integrins in MDA-MB-231 cells was quantified by qPCR and is shown in <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5a</xref>. There was a significant increase in ITG&#x003b1;1 in the NAT1 deleted cells, which was rescued when NAT1 was re-introduced. By contrast, there was a decrease in ITG&#x003b1;2 expression, but this was not rescued, suggesting the change was NAT1-independent. All of the other integrins showed similar expression in all three cell-lines. These results do not explain the reduction in invasion following NAT1 deletion, although the increase in ITG&#x003b1;1 is consistent with greater adhesion in the knockout cells.<fig id="F0005" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19336918.2019.1710015-F0005</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Role of integrins in MDA-MB-231 invasion (a) Integrin expression in parental (black bar), NAT1 knockout (open bar) and rescue (grey bar) cells.

Of particular interest is ITG&#x003b1;V, which is a marker of the mesenchymal phenotype in breast cancer cells and is highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. Cell surface ITG&#x003b1;V, quantified by flow cytometry, was significantly decreased in the NAT1 knockout cells, but was the same as the parental cells and the rescue line (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5b</xref>). To determine whether this decrease might account for the change in invasiveness, parental cells were treated with an anti-ITG&#x003b1;V antibody to block its function. <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5c</xref> shows that treatment decrease invasion to approximately the same as that seen in the NAT1 knockout cells. These results suggest changes in cell surface ITG&#x003b1;V expression may contribute to a decrease in cell invasion.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Discussion</title><p>The most striking finding from the current study is the apparent lack of involvement of the MMPs in NAT1-dependent invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. This was demonstrated by the absence of activated MMPs in the medium during the invasion assay, the minor effect that MMP activation by plasminogen produced in both parental and NAT1 deleted cells, and the lack of any effect of the pan-MMP inhibitor GM6001 on invasion. The results also show that the previously reported increase in MMP9 expression following NAT1 knockout [<xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>] is unrelated to invasion. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence of an association between MMP expression and breast cancer invasion and metastasis in patients, including MMP9 [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. However, clinical trials with numerous MMP inhibitors have shown little or no survival benefit and severe side-effects in cancer patients [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. The failure of MMP inhibitors may, in part, be due to a lack of understanding of when or how MMPs promote migration and invasion in different cancers. Alternatively, it may reflect other pathways that are equally or more important in tumor cell metastasis. In 3-dimensional invasion assays, MDA-MB-231 cell invasion was classified as protease-independent but adhesion-dependent, which is distinct from the typical adhesion independent amoeboid cell motility seen in many cancer cells [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. This is consistent with other studies into the mechanism of MMP-independent invasion for MDA-MB-231 cells [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. If the results reported here for the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells are applicable to other invasive breast cancers, then MMP inhibition will not be an appropriate strategy in these patients.</p><p>Inhibition of NAT1 expression in colon carcinoma HT-29 and prostate carcinoma cells 22Rv1 cells up-regulated e-cadherin, a marker of a more epithelial phenotype [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. Similarly, NAT1 deletion in MDA-MB-231 cells was associated with an increase in Snail expression and a loss of N-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin expression, which also suggests a more epithelial phenotype in these cells [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. Mesenchymal-epithelial plasticity also involves changes in integrin expression [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. The integrins are adhesion molecules that transmit information between the extracellular matrix, the cytoskeleton of the cells and various signalling pathways [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. In the current study, there were no changes in the major integrins that could easily explain the change in cell invasion. ITG&#x003b1;2 was significantly less in the NAT1 knockout cells, but this was not rescued when NAT1 was re-introduced. Cell surface expression of ITG&#x003b1;V was assessed because it heterodimerizes with many integrin &#x003b2; sub-units including &#x003b2;1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. ITG&#x003b1;V was down-regulated in the NAT1 deleted cells, and its surface expression was rescued. Thus, loss of ITG&#x003b1;V may explain the decrease in invasion as this integrin has been associated with invasion in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>] and breast cancer [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. When ITG&#x003b1;V was inhibited in the MDA-MB-231 cells, their invasiveness was similar to that seen in the NAT1 deleted cells. This is in agreement with previous findings demonstrating that ITG&#x003b1;v regulates MDA-MB-231 breast cancer invasion <italic>in vitro</italic>, as well as in zebrafish and mouse xenograft models [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>]. Moreover, previous studies have shown that ITG&#x003b1;v modulates invasion through regulation of mesenchymal genes such as N-cadherin and Snail [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cell invasion and metastasis involves filamentous actin-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling with the formation and dissolution of focal adhesion sites. NAT1 knockdown cells demonstrate impaired filopodia formation, which suggested that cytoskeletal remodeling may occurs in the absence of NAT1 [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. A close investigation of the size and shape of the NAT1 deleted cells confirmed distinct morphological changes that were rescued when NAT1 was re-introduced to the cells. Along with a small, more rounded morphology, the NAT1 deleted cells showed enhanced adherence to extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen. This was also seen following NAT1 deletion in HT-29 and HeLa cells. The increase in adhesion may be explained by the increase in ITG&#x003b1;1 seen in the NAT1 knockout cells. This integrin promotes adhesion to collagen. However, further work is required to demonstrate which integrin, if any, can explain the increased adhesion of NAT1 deleted cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we have discovered that NAT1 is required for optimal invasion of MDA-MD-231 cells the integrin signalling pathway.
