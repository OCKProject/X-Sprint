Finally, we explored the migration and invasion ability of LINC01272 by wound-healing and Transwell assays and examined the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins through Western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="S2003"><title>Results</title><p>We found that LINC01272 was upregulated in GC and was associated with GC staging and lymph node metastasis. The results of&#x000a0;wound-healing and Transwell assays revealed that the LINC01272 was closely related to GC cell migration and invasion. LINC01272 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion ability of GC cells by reducing the expression of EMT-related proteins.

The clinical information of patients was also downloaded. The quantile normalized log2 count per million expression values were used to perform clustering analysis. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering was based on Euclidean distance metric with Ward linkage using pheatmap package in R software (version 3.6.1). Differential expression analysis was performed based on raw count data using DESeq2 package in R software to screen deregulated lincRNAs. LincRNAs with Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P value &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. To identify key functional lincRNAs in gastric cancer, the Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID online tools. The GEPIA online tool was used to compare lincRNA expression between tumor and normal tissues in diverse cancer types. Furthermore, the transcript per million (TPM) expressions of lincRNAs and genes were used to perform Pearson correlation analysis in GEPIA. 8 gastric tumor tissues and 5 normal stomach tissues were collected from patients with GC at the first affiliated hospital of Chongqing Medical University.

Moreover, silencing of LINC01272 inhibited the migration and invasion ability of GC cells, while overexpression of LINC01272 had the opposite effect.</p><p>EMT refers to the biological process by which epithelial cells undergo specific changes to acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, and plays an important role in the development of human disease. Using proteomics, new molecular pathway related to this process has been identified including MAPK, PI3K/AKT, WNT pathways and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, thus providing critical insights into the development of novel therapeutic targets.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Recent studies have shown that EMT is associated with tumor cell migration and invasion, and cancer stem cell properties, including metastasis of glioma, human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and breast cancer.<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> And Recent evidence indicated that some lncRNAs could regulate the EMT process to promote tumor development, for example, LINC00460 silencing inhibited EMT in colon cancer via Upregulating miR-433-3p,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> overexpression of GATA6 antisense RNA 1 (GATA6-AS1) Inhibited EMT through the Wnt/b-Catenin Signaling Pathway in GC,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> CHRF promoted GC cell invasion and migration via regulating EMT.<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Using bioinformatic analysis, we predicted that LINC01272 expression was associated with the expression of EMT-related proteins. We found that the expression of MMP-9, MMP-2, Twist, and ZEB2 were reduced in LINC01272 knockdown GC cells. Hence, we believe that LINC01272 promoted the metastasis of GC cells via reduction of the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9.</p><p>Using a bioinformatics-based method, we found that LINC01272 was likely to be involved in GC Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage. The expression level of LINC01272 in early GC was higher than that in advanced GC. We grouped N0 stage and N1 stage together. The expression level of LINC01272 might be upregulated in N1 stage compared to N0 stage, then with a decline in advanced N stage. In addition, the tumor metastasis is a complicated process, and LINC01272 could promote migration and invasion in early N stage. However, due to the insufficient GC patients&#x02019; clinical data, it is difficult to analyze the relationship between LINC01272 expression levels and N stage. Thus, it is still necessary to enlarge GC samples in our future study. Metastasis is the typical malignant behavior of GC and is the reason why GC is difficult to completely cure. Recent evidence have indicated that the expression of cancer susceptibility 19 (CASC19),<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Rho GTPase activating protein 27 pseudogene 1 (ARHGAP27P1),<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16)<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> is significantly associated with higher pathologic TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and require further investigation.</p><p>In this study, our results indicated that LINC01272 is closely associated with migration and invasion in GC and may serve as a potential biomarker for the treatment of GC. Besides, LINC01272 is also highly expressed in other diseases. LINC01272 has been shown to be associated with a myeloid proinflammatory signature in Crohn&#x02019;s disease and was significantly upregulated in inflammatory bowel disease.<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Moreover, LINC01272 is closely related to the survival time of lung squamous cell carcinoma.<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Nevertheless, the target genes are unidentified and the mechanism remains unclear.
