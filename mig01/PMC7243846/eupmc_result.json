    "Endovascular coil embolization of cerebral aneurysm is a common procedure for managing cerebral aneurysms. We present a rare case of immediate silent coil migration into the pericallosal artery, without distal occlusion, following successful embolization. Despite the entire coil sitting within the lumen of the artery, good distal flow was observed. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout and had a good long-term (three years to date) outcome (modified Rankin ScaleÂ score of 1). We believe that the novel protective factor was the routine use of a single anti-platelet post-procedure."
