aggressive cases. Tumor microenvironment components as immune cells
contribute to the tumor progression; thereby, the modulation of immune cells
to a pro-inflammatory and antitumoral profile could potentialize the
immunotherapy, a suggested approach for high-risk patients. Preview studies
showed the antitumoral potential of BJcuL, a C- type lectin isolated from
<italic>Bothrops jararacussu</italic> venom. It was able to induce
immunomodulatory responses, promoting the rolling and adhesion of leukocytes
and the activation of neutrophils.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>SK-N-SH cells were incubated with conditioned media (CM) obtained during the
treatment of neutrophils with BJcuL and fMLP, a bacteria-derived peptide
highly effective for activating neutrophil functions. Then we evaluated the
effect of the same stimulation on the co-cultivation of neutrophils and
SK-N-SH cells. Tumor cells were tested for viability, migration, and
invasion potential.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In the viability assay, only neutrophils treated with BJcuL (24 h) and
cultivated with SK-N-SH were cytotoxic. Migration of tumor cells decreased
when incubated directly (p &#x0003c; 0.001) or indirectly (p &#x0003c; 0.005) with
untreated neutrophils. When invasion potential was evaluated, neutrophils
incubated with BJcuL reduced the total number of colonies of SK-N-SH cells
following co-cultivation for 24 h (p &#x0003c; 0.005). Treatment with CM resulted
in decreased anchorage-free survival following 24 h of treatment (p &#x0003c;
0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Data demonstrated that SK-N-SH cells maintain their migratory potential in
the face of neutrophil modulation by BJcuL, but their invasive capacity was
significantly reduced.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Snake venom</kwd><kwd>Neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>SK-N-SH cells</kwd><kwd>C-type lectin</kwd><kwd>Polymorphonuclear leukocyte</kwd><kwd>Neoplasm invasion</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="49"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>BJcuL is a lectin isolated from <italic>Bothrops jararacussu</italic> snake venom. It
is a typical representative of the C-type animal lectin superfamily, having the
carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), and exhibiting specificity for
&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactosides [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Previous
studies have shown that BJcuL has immunomodulatory effects. It can increase the
adhesion and rolling of leukocytes in the endothelium of pre-capillary vessels
[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], cause edema and increased vascular
permeability when injected into mouse hind paw [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We have shown that BJcuL modulates macrophage differentiation
towards a Th1 profile <italic>in vitro,</italic> with induction of phagocytosis,
production of ROS [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and secretion of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].
BJcuL is also capable of modulating neutrophils to a pro-inflammatory phenotype,
inducing the production of anion superoxide and increased phagocytic function [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In the tumor microenvironment (TME) cancer cells interact with extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins and non-tumor cells like fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells, and mature
immune cells [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that establish the overall characteristics of the tumor [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For example, cross talk between tumor
cells and neutrophils can be a determinant in tumor progression. The first direct
evidence of the cytotoxic effects of neutrophils on tumor cells was reported in 1972
[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and since then many studies have
contributed to this knowledge, as reviewed by Souto et al. [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Current data support a dual role for neutrophils in cancer
biology, in which cytotoxic neutrophils, called N1, contribute to tumor rejection or
increase immunological memory, thus combating tumor progression, and, on the other
side of this spectrum, N2 neutrophils may enable tumor development, invasion, and
metastasis [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. </p><p>Neuroblastoma (NB) is an extracranial tumor that may present during fetal development
or early after birth, derived from the neural crest neuroepithelial cells [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is characterized by heterogeneity and a
broad spectrum of clinical behaviors ranging from spontaneous regression without any
medical intervention to treatment resistant tumors with metastatic spread and poor
patient survival [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although there have been advances in the study, diagnosis,
and treatment of NB, most patients with advanced disease do not enter remission even
after treatment with multimodal therapies [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which may include immunotherapy in the post-consolidation phase [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigate the potential of BJcuL to induce an N1 or antitumoral
phenotype in neutrophils by analyzing the migration and invasion capabilities of NB
cells following treatment and, thus, highlight the potential of using animal toxins
and neutrophil modulation and showcase their use as effective weapons against
chemotherapy-resistant solid tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials</title><p>RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin and trypsin
were purchased from GIBCO (USA). Histopaque<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1077 and 1119, fMLP
(N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine), DCFH-DA
(2&#x02032;,7&#x02032;-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate) and methylene blue were all from
Sigma-Aldrich (USA). </p></sec><sec><title>Cells</title><p>Human neuroblastoma cells SK-N-SH (ATCC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> HTB-11&#x02122;) were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 IU/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL
streptomycin. Heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to a final 10%
concentration for culture expansion steps, or 2% for the scratch wound healing
assay. The cultures were maintained in a humid incubator at 37&#x000b0;C, with 5%
CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were isolated from peripheral blood of
healthy adults aged 20-40 years using a Histopaque<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> density gradient
as described by the manufacturer with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Peripheral blood was centrifuged at 1000 x
<italic>g</italic> for 20 min, and plasma was then centrifuged at 2000 x
<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove platelets. Plasma was then returned
to the collection tube and homogenized with the remaining blood cells.
Platelet-poor blood (6 mL) was added to tubes containing Histopaque 1119 + 1077
(6 mL), and centrifuged at 700 x <italic>g</italic> for 45 min. The PMN layer
was collected and centrifuged at 700 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min to allow for
the removal of residual Histopaque<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and then mixed back into red
blood cells (RBC) and plasma for a second round of centrifugation aiming to a
better recovery of PMN without contamination with RBC or peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC). </p><p>Aliquots of the PMN populations were analyzed on an Accuri<sup>TM</sup> C6
cytometer (BD Biosciences) for size (FSC, forward scatter) and complexity (SSC,
side scatter) characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>).
A differential blood cell count (ABX MICROS 60 automatic counter) was performed
before PMN isolation to verify that the cells were not pre-activated, based in
the number of PMN cells in the complete blood count (CBC). Any alteration in
percentage of PMN can indicate infection and thus a possible pre-activation of
those cells. Therefore, only the blood which presented differential count with
normal percentages of PMN was used.</p><p>

<italic>B. jararacussu</italic> venom was supplied by the Butantan Institute,
S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil. BJcuL was purified by affinity chromatography using an
agarose-D-galactose column and characterized as previously described by
Elifio-Esposito et al<italic>.</italic> [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Stimulation of SK-N-SH cells</title><p>SK-N-SK cells (1 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL) were co-cultured with neutrophils
(2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL) on a 24-well plate (300 &#x000b5;L/well), for 24 h in
RPMI with or without BJcuL (2.5 &#x003bc;g/mL) or fMLP (10 &#x000b5;M).</p><p>To obtain the conditioned media (CM), neutrophils (2.5 x 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL)
cultured in a 6-well plate (1 mL/well) were incubated with BJcuL (2.5 &#x003bc;g/mL),
fMLP (10 &#x000b5;g/mL), or 2% RPMI (untreated control) for 1 h or 24 h. The
supernatants were collected, centrifuged (2000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min),
filtered (0.22 &#x000b5;m), and kept frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until use. After the removal of the
CM, neutrophils from each treatment were stained with a DCFH-DA probe, according
to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed using an Accuri flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences), to estimate the intracellular hydrogen peroxide level. For
treatment of NB cells, CM was diluted 1:2 (v/v) with RPMI (2% FBS) and added to
wells containing the SK-N-SH tumor cells and incubated for 24 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Scratch Wound Healing (SWH)</title><p>
<italic>In vitro</italic> cell migration was evaluated using the scratch wound
healing (SWH) method, according to the previously described protocol [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], with the following modifications. NB
cells (3.5 x10<sup>5</sup> cells) were transferred to a 24-well plate, and after
24 h the cell monolayer was mechanically scratched. Detached cells were removed
by washing with RPMI. Cells were then treated for 24 h, as described before.
After treatment, cells were washed with RPMI and maintained in culture for
another 24 h. Photomicrographs of the wounds were taken immediately after their
formation (0 h) and at 48 h after (T48) using an EVOS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> XL microscope.
The wound width at T0 and T48 was measured using the ImageJ software plugin
(NIH, USA), and the migration distance was determined as the difference in width
between T0 and T48.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell viability assay</title><p> SK-N-SH cell viability was determined directly on the plate using the SWH test,
following the protocol described previously [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], with some modifications. Briefly, after completion of the SWH
assay, medium was removed, and 200 &#x000b5;L of methanol was added, and allowed to fix
for 10 min. Cells were then stained with 300 &#x000b5;L of 0.05% methylene blue for 10
min. Plates were washed by immersion and remained at room temperature for drying
for 24 h. About 300 &#x000b5;L of 0.1 M HCl was added and plates were agitated for 10
min. Following which 100 &#x000b5;L from each well was transferred to a 96-well plate
for absorbance reading on a microplate reader (ThermoPlate, TP Reader), at a
wavelength of 630 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Soft agar anchorage-free survival test</title><p>The soft agar test was performed in 48-well plates as previously described [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The bottom layer was made up of 250 &#x000b5;L
of 2X RPMI medium containing 20% of FBS and 250 &#x000b5;L of 1.2% agar in water. The
upper layer consisted of 250 &#x000b5;L of 2X RPMI medium (20% FBS), 2 x 10<sup>3</sup>
SK-N-SH cells, 125 &#x003bc;L of 1.2% agar and 125 &#x003bc;L of water. Every 72 h, 30 &#x000b5;L of 1X
RPMI medium (10% FBS) was added to form the feeding layer. SK-N-SH cells were
treated by the direct (BJcul or fMLP) or indirect method (CM) for 24 h prior to
being added to the upper layer. Results were obtained by direct colony counting
following 14 days of culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The results for the quantitative tests are represented by the mean &#x000b1; standard
deviation. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA, followed by multiple
comparison testing using the Tukey's or Dunnett&#x02019;s test. Statistical significance
was assigned for values where p &#x0003c; 0.05. Analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism Software, version 8.0 (La Jolla California, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>SK-N-SH cell migration is reduced in the presence of neutrophils and BJcuL
reverses this effect</title><p>The effects of BJcuL on NB cell migration were assessed by SWH assays following
two distinct stimulation procedures. In the indirect method, NB cells were
incubated for 24 h with conditioned media (CM) generated by culturing
neutrophils in RPMI medium containing BJcuL or fMLP for 1 h (NE1h-CM) or 24 h
(NE24h-CM). In the direct method, NB cells were co-cultivated with neutrophils
for 24 h, in the presence of BJcuL or fMLP. We also verified the direct effects
of BJcuL or fMLP on tumor cells, in the absence of neutrophils. </p><p>For the indirect assay, media obtained from non-stimulated neutrophils reduced
the migration rate of SK-N-SH cells when compared to RPMI control, although a
significant difference was found only for the 1h group. Even so, for both 1 h or
24 h conditions, CM from neutrophils treated with BJcuL and fMLP improved cell
migration compared to CM-RPMI, restoring the migration capacity, closer to RPMI
control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="suppl1">Additional file 1</xref>).
Cell viability analysis was done to exclude the possibility that the behavior
observed in the SWH assay was the result of cellular proliferation. The
viability of the neuroblastoma cells was not affected in treatments with
conditioned media. </p><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Neutrophils treated with BJcuL reduce the invasion of SK-N-SH cells</title><p>The invasion capacity of tumor cells <italic>in vitro</italic> was determined
using the soft agar method. The principle of this method is that malignantly
transformed cells lose their anchorage dependence and can grow and form colonies
within a semi-solid agar matrix. All tested conditions, i.e., with direct or
indirect stimulation of SK-N-SH cells, led to a decrease in the number of
colonies when compared to the RPMI group. After 24 h of co-culture with
neutrophils in RPMI alone (NE-RPMI) or in the presence of BJcuL or fMLP
(NE-BJcuL; NE-fMLP), the invasion capacity of SK-N-SH was reduced by
approximately 30%, when compared to the untreated control (RPMI). Incubation of
tumor cells with the conditioned media (CM-RPMI) also reduced the number of
colonies, which was more pronounced for the CM from neutrophils treated with
BJcuL (CM-BJcuL) and fMLP (CM-fMLP), with a drop of 40% and 35% in the number of
colonies, respectively, when compared with the RPMI control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). </p><p>

activity assessed by monitoring ROS production after incubation with BJcuL and
fMLP for 1h and 24 h. It was added a 12h-stimulation condition to uncover the
profile of ROS production along time, even if no CM was generated for this time
point. BJcuL and fMLP stimulated cells showed a higher level of intracellular
hydrogen peroxide when compared to the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). For fMLP treated cells there was a significant
increase after 1 h of stimulation, which gradually reduced to the 24 h time
point. BJcuL produced the opposite profile, with low intracellular ROS content
after 1 h of stimulation, and a statistically significant increase in ROS
production after 12 h and 24 h.</p><p>

viper snake venoms [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The
pro-inflammatory potential of <italic>B. jararacussu</italic> venom lectin was
reported previously [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which includes
the induction of neutrophil polarization [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
In this study, we demonstrated that the modulation of neutrophils by BJcuL reduced
the viability and invasion capacity of human neuroblastoma cells <italic>in
vitro</italic>. As neutrophil polarization is likely driven by TME [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>],
neutrophils were tested in the presence and absence of tumor cells.</p><p>Exogenous chemotaxins, as fMLP , attract neutrophils to inflammatory sites to
recognize and kill pathogens through a combination of cytotoxic mechanisms [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
Emerging evidence supports that neutrophils may also be cytotoxic to tumor cells
[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our results show that a significant reduction in SK-N-SH cell
viability occurs when they are cultivated directly with neutrophils for 24 h in the
presence of BJcuL, but not fMLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2</xref> and
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3</xref>), which is consistent with the increasing
levels of intracellular hydrogen peroxide found by BJcuL-treated neutrophils within
24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). ROS-mediated cell killing was
shown to be dependent on tumor cell expression of TRPM2, an H2O2-dependent calcium
channel, which upon activation results in a lethal influx of calcium ions into the
cell [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The conditioned media generated by the cultivation of neutrophils
did not affect NB cell viability, which may be due to the different in the
concentration of the cytotoxic agents, as the CM was diluted for the incubation with
NB cells.</p><p>As previously reported, BJcuL reduces the degree of late apoptosis in neutrophils,
decreasing in 50% in the number of apoptotic cells after 24 h of incubation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A recent study showed that mediators of
delayed apoptotic cell death pathways of N1 cells can keep the system in the
safe-guard immune N1 zone [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. BJcuL could
induce PMNs to exert a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, and also favor the
maintenance of an activated profile with effects on other aspects of tumor
progression.</p><p>Metastasis remains the leading cause of death for patients with cancer [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is a multistep process that involves
the collective cell migration, which heavily relies on the cooperation of the
cytoskeleton, the cellular surface adhesion proteins, and the extracellular matrix
(ECM) components [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The secretion of cytokines by neutrophils, like components
of the IL-6 family and IL-8, for example, as well as growth factors [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>],
can promote ECM remodeling in the TME [94]. Furthermore, mature neutrophils possess
granules containing a reservoir of enzymes, including myeloperoxidase (MPO),
neutrophil elastase (NE), and also metalloproteinases (MMPs), capable of remodeling
the ECM by stabilizing integrins [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Cell
adhesion mediated mainly through the interaction of integrin receptors with their
ECM ligands is a requirement for many cell types to proliferate and survive [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we found by SWH assay, a significant reduction in tumor cell migration
when SK-N-SH cells were incubated directly with untreated neutrophils. These results
were unexpected considering that circulating "normal" PMNs are described not to
affect the adhesion and migration of tumor cells [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Regardless, the addition of either BJcuL or fMLP, both described to
increase the pro-inflammatory potential of neutrophil, increased the migration
capacity of NB cells. Neutrophil-tumor cell interaction was not the determining
factor in this case, as the direct and indirect stimulation resulted in the same
way. Furthermore, anchorage-free survival assays showed that incubation with
untreated or stimulated neutrophils reduced the invasive power of neuroblastoma
cells, which is even greater in the presence of BJcuL or fMLP. </p><p>The recognition of specific glycans by lectins represents a key event in a variety of
biological phenomena involving cell-cell and cell-ECM component interactions [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].
BJcuL, as Galatrox, another C-type lectin derived from <italic>B. atrox</italic>
snake venom, can interact with glycans on neutrophils and macrophages surfaces, as
well as with ECM proteins. They have been described also as stimulants of the
neutrophils release of pro-inflammatory mediators, others than ROS, such as IL-6,
and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These properties together could favor and stabilize
cellular adhesion, facilitating migration but also reducing anchorage-free
survival.</p><p>The complexity of the tumor microenvironment cannot be easily recapitulated
<italic>in vitro</italic>. The master signals exchanged between various cell
types within the tumor mass is critical, and evidence supports that cytokines
control pro-tumor versus anti-tumor immune responses by polarizing neutrophil
subpopulations to N1 or N2 phenotypes. However, even with the limitations, we
reinforce in this study, that BJcuL affects the behavior of neutrophils <italic>in
vitro</italic> and that such action can be a mechanism to be explored in order
to better understand the processes involved in neutrophils anti-invasive action.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results showed that BJcuL-treated neutrophils could significantly affect the
behavior of neuroblastoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Viability was reduced
when neutrophils were co-cultivated with the tumor cells, while the increment of
cellular migration and the reduction of anchorage-free survival were also observed
by the incubation of tumor cells with the neutrophil-conditioned media. Efforts must
be made to identify the signaling molecules exposed on the cellular surface or
secreted by neutrophils in order to explain the presented data.</p><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CBC: complete blood count; CM: conditioned media; CRD: carbohydrate recognition
