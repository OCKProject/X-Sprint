    "For Pacific salmon captured and released by fisheries, post-release behaviour and survival may be influenced by their health and condition at time of capture. We sought to characterize the interactions between infectious agent burden, fish immune and stress physiology and fisheries stressors to investigate the potential for capture-mediated pathogen-induced mortality in adult coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch. We used radio-telemetry paired with high-throughput qPCR of non-lethal gill biopsies for infectious agents and host biomarkers from 200 tagged fish experimentally displaced and exposed to various experimental fisheries treatments (gill net entanglement, recreational angling and recreational angling with air exposure vs. non-sampled control). We characterized relationships among post-release behaviour and survival, infectious agent presence and loads, physiological parameters and transcription profiles of stress and immune genes. All infectious agents detected were endemic and in loads consistent with previous adult Pacific salmon monitoring. Individuals exposed to fisheries treatments were less likely to reach spawning habitat compared to controls, and handling duration independent of fisheries gear had a negative effect on survival. High infectious agent burden was associated with accelerated migration initiation post-release, revealing behavioural plasticity in response to deteriorating condition in this semelparous species. Prevalence and load of infectious agents increased post-migration as well as transcription signatures reflected changes in immune and stress profiles consistent with senescence. Results from this study further our understanding of factors associated with fisheries that increase risk of post-release mortality and characterize some physiological mechanisms that underpin migratory behaviour."
