In this study, we demonstrate that miR-520b is downregulated in MHCC-97H cells, a liver cancer cell line with high potential of metastasis, compared with MHCC-97L cells which has a low potential of metastasis. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of miR-520b could inhibit liver cancer cell migration, while silencing its expression resulted in increased migration. Mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) was identified as a direct and functional new target of miR-520b. This regulation was also confirmed by luciferase reporter assays. In addition, our results showed that overexpression of the MLK3 expression partially reversed the effect of miR-520b on liver cancer cell migration, indicating that MLK3 contributes to the migration in liver cancer. The newly identified miR-520b/MLK3 axis partially elucidates the molecular mechanism of liver cancer cell migration and represents a new potential therapeutic target for liver cancer treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Natural science research projects in Universities in Anhui (No. KJ2017A777) and The Key Program in the Youth Elite Support Plan in Universities of Anhui Province (No. gxyqZD2016463).

Recently, next generation sequencing of liver cancer patients has revealed that tons of genes are deregulated during the progression of liver cancer, and that the dysregulation of these genes are closely correlated with liver cancer diagnosis and prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is important to identify the dysregulated genes in liver cancer and to investigate their roles in liver cancer carcinogenesis and progression.</p><p>MicroRNAs are a class of short noncoding RNAs, which are able to inhibit the expression of their target genes through binding with the 3&#x02019;-untranslated region of target mRNA [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. More and more studies has demonstrated that miRNAs can function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Meanwhile, miRNAs are closely involved in tumor development, such as tumor proliferation, migration or metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The dysregulated expression of many miRNAs have been reported before, such as miR-520b. The overexpression or downregulation of miR-520b has been reported in many cancers, such as glioma, lung cancer and ovarian cancer. MiR-520b is reported to suppress glioma progression by targeting MBD2 [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Meanwhile, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166052/">MiR-520b restrains cell growth by targeting HDAC4 in lung cancer</ext-link> [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

Several studies revealed that miR-520b could inhibit liver cancer growth and functioned as a tumor suppressor miRNA [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the effect of miR-520b on the migration of liver cancer is still uncertain.</p><p>MLK3, also known as MAP3K11, was first identified in 1994 [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. MLK3 can phosphorylate and activate MAP2Ks, and then activate MAPKs. Overexpression of MLK3 was shown to induce transformation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts by activation of MEK signaling [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, accumulating evidence showed that MLK3 may play important functions in tumor migration or invasion. It is reported that MLK3 promotes colorectal cancer invasion [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] MLK3 is also reported to drive invasion and migration in breast cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the function of MLK3 in liver cancer needs further investigation.</p><p>In this study, our data demonstrated that miR-520b was downregulated in liver cancer cells. We also found that miR-520b inhibited the migration of liver cancer cells partially through targeting MLK3. Our results demonstrated the effect of miR-520b and MLK3 on the migration of liver cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>L02, HepG2, MHCC-97L and MHCC-97Hcells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies).

We found that miR-520b could significantly reduce the luciferase activity of PGL3 vector with MLK3 3'UTR sequence but not the vector with mutant-type sequence. We then measured the protein level of MLK3 in L02, HepG2, MHCC-97L and MHCC-97H cells. Our data showed that the expression of MLK3 is upregulated in all the three liver cancer cell lines, which is correlated with the downregulation of miR-520b in those cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230716.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Moreover, our result also showed that overexpression of miR-520b significantly downregulated the expression of MLK3 in HepG2 cells at both mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230716.g003">Fig 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230716.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

The etiology and occurrence of liver cancer often related with the increasing incidence of HBV and HCV infection and accompanied with a poor prognosis. Although early stage surgery and diagnosis of liver cancer has improved, the worse prognosis and high risk of recurrence after surgery due to invasion and migration made the treatment of liver cancer challenging. Accumulating evidence indicated that the dysregulated expression of miRNAs play important roles during the progression of liver cancer. MiRNAs are involved in tumor initiation, migration and proliferation by regulating the expression of tumor suppressors or oncogenes. Although many miRNAs were dysregulated in liver cancer, the underlying mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate the processes of tumorigenesis and cancer progression are still largely unknown. In this work, we observed that miR-520b was significantly downregulated in a liver cancer cells with high metastasis potential. And then we demonstrated the miR-520b overexpression suppressed the migration of liver cancer cells. Meanwhile, we found that MLK3 was a newly identified target gene of miR-520b.</p><p>Many studies reported the role of miR-520b in human cancers. Most of the studies reported that miR-520b worked as a tumor suppressor in cancer. For example, it is reported that miR-520b inhibited proliferation of lung cancer, prostate cancer, glioma, head-neck cancer and colorectal cancer et al [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, recently, the oncogenic role of miR-520b was also reported in ovarian cancer [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which reveals that the effect of miR-520b may be context-dependent and needs further investigation in different tissues. Currently, accumulating evidences all indicate a tumor suppressor function in liver cancer [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Previous studies showed that miR-520b could inhibit growth or proliferation of liver cancer cells by target oncogenes, such as CCND1. Meanwhile, previous studies also reported that miR-520b could inhibit the migration of cancer cells in gastric cancer, breast cancer and Spinal Osteosarcoma Cells [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, there is no report about the role of miR-520b on liver cancer migration or metastasis. Here we first demonstrated that miR-520b inhibited the migration and invasion of liver cancer cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is also reported that miR-520b could inhibit migration of gastric cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is consistent with our results. Our data suggest a role of miR-520b on promotion of liver cancer migration.</p><p>MLK3 is widely reported as an oncogene in human cancers, especially in breast cancer [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. MLK3 is required during tumorigenesis and inhibition of MLK3 could block the oncogenic function of MLK3 in cancer cells. It is also reported that certain miR-125b and miR-199a-5p could target MLK3 and inhibit tumor migration or tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0230716.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230716.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The function of MLK3 in liver cancer is still unclear. Our data showed that MLK3 is a direct target of miR-520b which may work as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer. Our also showed that overexpression of MLK3 rescued the effect of miR-520b on cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. Meanwhile, we believe that miR-520b regulates liver cancer cell migration not only through MLKs but also by HBXIP, EGFR or the other target genes. In our study, we mainly found that MLK3 is a new target of miR-520b and is involved in the promotion of liver cancer cells. Our findings support an oncogenic role of MLK3 in liver cancer, which needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data support that miR-520b significantly suppressed the migration of liver cancer cells partially through targeting MLK3.
