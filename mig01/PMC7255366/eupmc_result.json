    "Background: Gliomas are the most prevalent primary malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Our previous study showed that miR-204-5p is a tumor suppressor gene in glioma. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) is a potential target gene of miR-204-5p. Methods: We analyzed the expression of XIST and miR-204-5p in glioma tissues and the correlation with glioma grade. A series of in vitro experiments were carried out to elucidate the role of XIST in glioma progression. A mouse xenograft model was established to detect whether knockdown of XIST can inhibit glioma growth. A luciferase assay was performed to determine whether XIST can bind to miR-204-5p and the binding specificity. Cells stably expressing shXIST or shNC were transfected with anti-miR-204-5p or anti-miR-204-5p-NC to evaluate whether XIST mediates the tumor-suppressive effects of miR-204-5p. Results: XIST was upregulated in glioma tissues compared with normal brain tissues (NBTs), while miR-204-5p expression was significantly decreased in glioma tissues compared with NBTs. Both XIST and miR-204-5p expression levels were clearly related to glioma grade, and the expression of XIST was obviously negatively correlated with miR-204-5p expression. Knockdown of XIST inhibited glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, promoted apoptosis of glioma cells, inhibited tumor growth and increased the survival time in nude mice. miR-204-5p could directly bind to XIST and negatively regulate XIST expression. XIST mediated glioma progression by targeting miR-204-5p in glioma cells. XIST crosstalk with miR-204-5p regulated Bcl-2 expression to promote apoptosis. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that XIST, miR-204-5p and Bcl-2 form a regulatory axis that controls glioma progression and can serve as a potential therapeutic target for glioma."
