    "INTRODUCTION:Silicone oil has been used for many years in retinal surgeries for retinal detachment. One of its reported complications is oil migration to the periorbital area, resulting in granulomatous reaction. PRESENTATION OF CASE:A 56-year-old lady, with history of retinal detachment that was repaired by vitrectomy, silicone oil removal and epi-retinal membrane peeling, presented to us with unilateral ptosis and a skin lesion that resembled xanthelasma. DISCUSSION:Histopathology of this lesion showed silicone oil infiltrating the surrounding connective tissue and fat with absence of foamy histiocytes. CONCLUSION:We are reporting a case of silicone oil migration with pseudo-xanthelasma lesion. This has been reported only twice to the best of our knowledge in the English-written literature."
