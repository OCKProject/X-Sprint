    "During the last few decades, cell-based anti-tumor immunotherapy emerged and it has provided us with a large amount of knowledge. Upon chemokines recognition, immune cells undergo rapid trafficking and activation in disease milieu, with immune cells chemotaxis being accompanied by activation of diverse intercellular signal transduction pathways. The outcome of chemokines-mediated immune cells chemotaxis interacts with the cue of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Indeed, the mTOR cascade in immune cells involves migration and infiltration. In this review, we summarize the available mTOR-related chemokines, as well as the characterized upstream regulators and downstream targets in immune cells chemotaxis and assign potential underlying mechanisms in each evaluated chemokine. Specifically, we focus on the involvement of mTOR in chemokine-mediated immune related cells in the balance between tumor immunity and malignancy."
