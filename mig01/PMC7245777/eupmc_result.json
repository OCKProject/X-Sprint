    "Background:MicroRNA 942-5p (miR-942-5p) has been reported to promote migration and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. The interplay between long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs plays a crucial role in tumor progression. Methods:In the present study, we performed bioinformatic and biochemical analyses to identify miR-942-5p-interacting lncRNAs. The function and clinical significance of the candidate lncRNA(s) in NSCLC were determined. Results:We identified LIFR-AS1 as a pivotal miR-942-5p-interacting lncRNA. Overexpression of miR-942-5p caused a reduction of LIFR-AS1 in NSCLC cells. LIFR-AS1 showed the ability to sponge miR-942-5p, leading to derepression of ZNF471. Functionally, LIFR-AS1 overexpression inhibited NSCLC cell migration and invasion, whereas LIFR-AS1 silencing yielded an opposite effect. In vivo studies confirmed that LIFR-AS1 overexpression suppressed lung metastasis of NSCLC cells. Rescue experiments demonstrated that enforced expression of miR-942-5p or depletion of ZNF471 restored the migration and invasion capacity of LIFR-AS1-overexpressing cells. Moreover, overexpression of ZNF471 restrained NSCLC cell invasion. Clinically, LIFR-AS1 downregulation was significantly correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and reduced overall survival in NSCLC patients. Conclusions:we provide first evidence for the involvement of the LIFR-AS1/miR-942-5p/ZNF471 axis in NSCLC invasion and metastasis. LIFR-AS1 may represent a novel target for the treatment of NSCLC."
