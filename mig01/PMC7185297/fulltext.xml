Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a potential therapeutic source of cells following central nervous system damage; however, few studies have investigated the effects of BMSCs on cell migration. Thus, in the present study, the effects of BMSCs on NPC migration were investigated. In the present study, BMSCs and NPCs were isolated and cultured from mice. The effects of BMSCs on the migration of NPCs were analyzed using a Transwell cell migration assay. BMSCs were transfected with microRNA-210 (miR-210) mimics and inhibitors to examine the effects of the respective upregulation and downregulation of miR-210 in BMSCs on the migration of NPCs. Then, miR-210 expression in BMSCs were quantified and the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and chemokine C-C motif ligand 3 (CCL3) in the supernatant under hypoxic conditions were investigated via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and ELISA. Subsequently, the expression of VEGF-C, BDNF and CCL3 in BMSCs overexpressing miR-210 or BMSCs suppressing miR-210 was examined by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses. BMSCs promoted the migration of NPC, particularly when pre-cultured with BMSCs for 24 h and co-cultured with NPCs for 24 h; the miR-210 expression levels increased under hypoxic conditions. Additionally, the migration of NPCs was also increased when the BMSCs overexpressed miR-210 compared with the BMSCs transfected with a negative control miR and BMSCs with downregulated miR-210 levels. The expression levels of VEGF-C increased in the BMSCs that overexpressed miR-210 and were decreased in BMSCs transfected with a miR-210 inhibitor. The results of the present study indicated that BMSCs promote the migration of NPCs. Overexpression of miR-210 in BMSCs enhanced NPC migration and may be associated with increases in VEGF-C expression levels.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microRNA-210</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>neural precursor cells</kwd><kwd>vascular endothelial growth factor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ischemia, hypoxia, reperfusion injury and other factors caused by apoplexy may result in brain injury (<xref rid="b1-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). At present, cell therapy is considered a promising method for the treatment of cerebral injury, and numerous preclinical studies have made notable progress. For cytotherapy, stem cells are particularly valued for their strong proliferation and differentiation characteristics. Several studies have investigated cytotherapy for the treatment of cerebral injury, including strategies using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), neural stem cells (NSCs), neural precursor cells (NPCs), embryonic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells (<xref rid="b2-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Stem cell therapy is an emerging therapeutic modality in the treatment of stroke. The basis stems from the observation that certain parts of the adult brain are capable of regeneration (<xref rid="b8-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of preclinical studies demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells used to treat ischemic stroke were associated with improvements in neurological function (<xref rid="b9-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>); however, important questions remain unanswered, and translation to the clinical remains a distant prospect.</p><p>The ability of self-renewal and differentiation of MSCs into neural cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, as demonstrated by the expression of neuronal markers such as neuronal nuclear antigen, and non-ethical and tissue rejection-associated concerns make their use a promising therapeutic approach for stroke treatment (<xref rid="b10-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). BMSCs can protect neurons from hypoxia (<xref rid="b11-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The experimental rationale for the use of MSCs in stroke therapy involves a number of divergent mechanisms of action, including differentiation into cell types relevant to repair, modulation of the immune system, promotion of angiogenesis, neurogenesis and synapse formation, paracrine secretion of neuroprotective and neurotrophic factors (<xref rid="b12-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The interaction between BMSCs and other cells in the brain-injured area to further promote damage repair requires further investigation (<xref rid="b10-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>NSCs/NPCs are present in the subventricular zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus of mammals (<xref rid="b14-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). NSCs have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into neurons, astrocytes or microglia with appropriate stimulation (<xref rid="b17-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Following brain injury, NSCs/NPCs can be activated; they proliferate and differentiate into neurons under pathological conditions (<xref rid="b19-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The migration of NSCs/NPCs to the focal lesion is key to promoting injury-associated repair. The effective migration of exogenous or endogenous NSCs can promote functional reconstruction of the nervous system (<xref rid="b15-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Investigations have been performed; however, there is still a lack of clear and effective methods to promote the directional migration of NSCs/NPCs. The number of NPCs that migrate to the lesion is very small; thus, it is also necessary to determine an efficient method to promote NPC migration and appropriate targeting of NPCs.</p><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are 20&#x02013;24 nucleotide RNAs that regulate the translation or expression levels of target mRNA transcripts (<xref rid="b20-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Previous studies suggested that miR-210 specifically is a robust target of hypoxia-inducible factors, and miR-210 has complex roles in the cellular responses to hypoxia (<xref rid="b21-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Previous studies reported that miR-210 is closely associated with ischemic stroke; miR-210 is not only upregulated in endothelial cells under hypoxic conditions, but also promotes angiogenesis (<xref rid="b24-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and is closely associated with the physiological and pathological status of the nervous system (<xref rid="b25-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Hypoxic preconditioning can increase the expression of miR-210 in BMSCs. Ischemic preconditioning augments the survival of stem cells via miR-210 expression by targeting caspase-8-associated protein 2. Liu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b18-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) also confirmed that miR-210 expression in NSCs/NPCs is increased significantly under hypoxic conditions. Our previous studies revealed that the transplanted BMSCs localized to the ischemic foci following cerebral ischemia (<xref rid="b27-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). The penumbra surrounding the ischemic foci was hypoxic following cerebral ischemia (<xref rid="b28-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Additionally, miR-210 expression was demonstrated to be significantly increased in ischemic brain tissue (<xref rid="b24-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b29-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Therefore, it was hypothesized that the expression levels of miR-210 in BMSCs around the ischemic foci following cerebral ischemia increased in the hypoxic environment, which may promote the migration of NSCs to the surrounding ischemic foci. This hypothesis was investigated in the present study by detecting the expression of miR-210 in BMSCs under hypoxic conditions and the effect of BMSCs on NPC migration. In addition, the present study also investigated the effect of miR-210 overexpression and inhibition in BMSCs on the migration of NPCs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Isolation and cultivation of mouse BMSCs</title><p>Initially, ten 4- to 6-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (weight 12&#x02013;18 g, Hunan SJA Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd., Changsha, China; <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.hnsja.com/">http://www.hnsja.com/</uri>) were housed in specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions (air cleanliness: Level 7, temperature: 22&#x000b1;2&#x000b0;C) with free access to sterilized food and ultra pure water. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The femur was obtained under sterile conditions. The ends of the femur were removed, and PBS was used to flush out the bone marrow. Following filtering with a 200-&#x000b5;m mesh filter, the bone marrow cell suspension was centrifuged at 200 &#x000d7; g for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C.

These mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Under sterile conditions, the abdominal skin, muscle and uterus were cut so as to obtain mouse embryos. The telencephalon was isolated, the meninges were removed and the tissue was cut into pieces under a stereomicroscope. The tissue was digested with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA at 37&#x000b0;C and agitated every 5 min until a homogenized solution was obtained. Then, the complete media containing serum (DMEM/F12+10% FBS) was added to stop the digestion.

The NPCs developed into a bulb shape. The media was changed every 2 days. The NPCs were identified by the immunofluorescent staining of &#x003b2;-tubulin III, doublecortin (DCX) and nestin. The NPCs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, washed with PBS twice and treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min.

DCX is a microtubule-associated protein expressed by NPCs. DCX is expressed within NPCs during active division, and their neuronal daughter cells continue to express DCX for 2&#x02013;3 weeks as the cells mature into neurons (<xref rid="b33-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The protein nestin is widely used as a marker of NSCs and NPCs, and &#x003b2;-tubulin III is a general marker of neurons. The identification, isolation and cultivation of NPCs were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining with anti-nestin, anti-DCX and anti-&#x003b2;-tubulin III antibodies.

Subsequently, the effects of BMSCs on NPC migration were investigated using a Transwell cell migration assay. The present study examined four groups: Pre-cultured BMSCs for 24 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 15 h; pre-cultured BMSCs for 24 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 24 h; pre-cultured BMSCs for 48 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 15 h, and pre-cultured BMSCs for 48 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 24 h. The number of migrated NPCs was greatest in the group of BMSCs pre-cultured for 24 h and co-cultured NPCs for 24 h, which was significantly higher than any other group [pre-cultured BMSCs for 24 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 24 h vs. pre-cultured BMSCs for 24 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 15 h (P=0.045); pre-cultured BMSCs for 48 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 15 h (P=0.041); and pre-cultured BMSCs for 48 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 24 h (P&#x0003c;0.001); <xref rid="f3-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>]. The number of migrated NPCs in the group of pre-cultured BMSCs for 48 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 24 h was significantly lower than that in the pre-cultured BMSCs for 24 h, co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 24 h, pre-cultured BMSCs for 48 h and co-cultured BMSCs/NPCs for 15 h (P&#x0003c;0.001; <xref rid="f3-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).

As miR-210 expression levels were significantly upregulated in BMSCs under hypoxia, the effects of miR-210 overexpression and inhibition in BMSCs on the migration of NPCs were investigated in the present study. miR-210 mimics or inhibitors were transfected into BMSCs to upregulate or downregulate miR-210 expression, respectively. The miR-210 expression levels in BMSCs were increased following transfection with miR-210 mimics. The miR-210 expression levels were highest in BMSCs transfected with miR-210 mimics for 48 h, which was significantly higher than that in the BMSCs transfected with NC miRNA for 24 or 48 h, and within BMSCs transfected with miR-210 mimics for 24 h [miR-210 mimics 48 h vs. NC miRNA 24 h (P=0.001), NC miRNA 48 h (P=0.001) and miR-210 mimics 24 h, (P=0.002); <xref rid="f5-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>].</p><p>The miR-210 expression levels in BMSCs decreased following transfection with miR-210 inhibitors.

Thus, the BMSCs transfected with miR-210 mimic for 48 h and BMSCs transfected with miR-210 inhibitor for 24 h for further experiments to investigate the effects of miR-210 expression in BMSCs on NPC migration.</p><p>Subsequently, the effect of miR-210 expression in BMSCs on NPC migration was investigated in the present study. The number of migrated NPCs was significantly higher in the miR-210 overexpressing BMSC group than in the NC BMSCs group (P=0.028; <xref rid="f6-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Conversely, the number of migrated NPCs in the miR-210-suppressed group (BMSCs suppressing miR-210 expression pre-cultured for 24 h and BMSCs suppressing miR-210 expression/NPCs co-cultured for 24 h) was significantly decreased compared with that in the NC BMSCs group (<xref rid="f6-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>; P=0.023). Compared with in the NC BMSCs with co-cultured NPCs for 24 h group, the BMSCs overexpressing miR-210 significantly promoted the migration of NPCs. Reducing the expression of miR-210 in BMSCs resulted in fewer migrated NPCs. The results of the present study suggested that miR-210 had an important role in the migration of NPCs in this co-culture system.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of miR-210 on the expression levels of BDNF, CCL3 and VEGF-C in BMSC</title><p>As aforementioned, under hypoxic conditions, miR-210 was upregulated; BDNF, VEGF-C, and CCL3 expression levels were also upregulated or downregulated by hypoxia. It was hypothesized that miR-210 may regulate BDNF, VEGF-C and CCL3 gene expression; the effects of miR-210 overexpression or inhibition on the expression of BDNF, CCL3 and VEGF-C in BMSCs were investigated. From RT-qPCR analyses, BDNF mRNA expression levels in the BMSCs overexpressing miR-210 or BMSCs suppressing miR-210 expression were not significantly different from the NC BMSCs group (<xref rid="f7-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). The CCL3 mRNA expression levels were significantly downregulated in BMSCs when miR-210 was overexpressed (<xref rid="f7-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>; P=0.029) or suppressed (<xref rid="f7-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>; P=0.014). The VEGF-C mRNA expression levels were significantly increased (<xref rid="f7-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>; P=0.005) when miR-210 was overexpressed in BMSCs and significantly decreased when miR-210 was reduced (<xref rid="f7-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>; P=0.037). The present study determined the effects of miR-210 on the protein expression levels of BDNF, CCL3 and VEGF-C in BMSCs. Consistent with the mRNA expression levels, the western blot analyses indicated that BDNF expression levels were not significantly different when miR-210 was overexpressed or suppressed in BMSCs compared with in the NC BMSCs group (<xref rid="f8-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).

Once locally or systematically injected, about 1/3 of the locally injected stem cells migrated toward the damaged region (<xref rid="b38-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Following ischemic stroke, NPCs proliferate within major germinal niches of the brain (<xref rid="b39-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). In recent years, numerous studies have reported an interaction between BMSCs and NSCs during brain injury repair. Haragopal <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b40-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) revealed that the direct effects of BMSCs on NSCs may enhance the stemness of NSCs via the Notch-1 signaling pathway, which may be useful for establishing human neural stem cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic> for basic research, clinical research and clinical transplantation. Wang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b41-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) reported that BMSCs regulated the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs via the Notch signaling pathway. Similarly, NSCs may affect BMSCs; Alexanian (<xref rid="b36-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) suggested that NSCs may induce BMSCs to differentiate into neural stem-like cells; however, it is unknown whether BMSCs regulate the migration of NSCs/NPCs. In the present study, BMSCs were employed to induce NPC migration, which may resolve the key problem of NSC/NPC migration following brain injury. In the present study, the effects of BMSCs on NPC migration were investigated via a Transwell cell migration assay. The results of the present study revealed that pre-culturing BMSCs for 24 h and co-culturing BMSCs and NPCs for 24 h may significantly improve NPC migration compared with pre-culturing BMSCs for 48 h. These findings suggested that 24 h may be an optimal duration for NPC migration; the BMSCs exhibited a stronger ability to promote NPC migration with in relatively a shorter duration of pre-culture of 24 h than 48 h. These observations may be associated with the decreased cell growth and proliferation due to contact-dependent inhibition when BMSCs are pre-cultured for 48 h (<xref rid="b42-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b44-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>BMSCs may be located in a hypoxic environment if BMSCs are stereotactically injected into the focal ischemic area or if BMSCs migrate to the infarct border zone via intravenous injection post-ischemic brain damage. miR-210 is a hypoxia-responsive miRNA that can combine with hypoxia inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;). miR-210 expression levels were increased in cells or tissues significantly under hypoxic conditions (<xref rid="b18-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b45-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="b46-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).

Nie <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b47-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) confirmed that the overexpression of miR-210 significantly promoted the survival of BMSCs under hypoxic conditions. Sun <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b48-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) also reported that miR-210 may form a positive feedback loop with HIF-1&#x003b1; to promote the survival of osteoblast cells post-hypoxia. miR-210 also exhibited protective effects on NSCs/NPCs; Wang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b49-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) reported that miR-210 inhibited the apoptosis of NPCs by inhibiting BNIP3. In addition to the protective effects on cell survival during hypoxia, miR-210 may also exhibit an effect on cell migration. Zhang <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b50-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) confirmed that phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 can promote the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells by the nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B/HIF-1&#x003b1;/miR-210 axis. Similarly, Qu <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b51-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) also reported that the overexpression of miR-210 may promote the migration of colorectal cancer cells. In the present study, the upregulation of miR-210 in BMSCs may have enhanced the effect of BMSCs on NPC migration, while the downregulation of miR-210 in BMSCs may have reduced the effect of BMSCs on NPC migration. Thus, miR-210 may serve an important role in the process of BMSC-induced regulation of NPC migration.</p><p>In the present study, miR-210 expression levels were increased in BMSCs under hypoxic conditions. VEGF-C and CCL3 expression levels were significantly increased in the supernatant of BMSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions compared with that of BMSCs cultured under normal conditions; while BDNF expression decreased significantly. To investigate whether the alterations in BDNF, VEGF-C and CCL3 expression may be regulated by miR-210, the expression levels of BDNF, VEGF-C and CCL3 in BMSCs overexpressing miR-210 or suppressing miR-210 expression were analyzed. VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression levels were increased significantly; however, the expression levels of CCL3 and BDNF protein did not change significantly in BMSCs overexpressing miR-210. Additionally, VEGF-C expression levels were significantly decreased, CCL3 expression decreased significant and BDNF expression did not change significantly in BMSCs with reduced miR-210 expression levels. The association between CCL3 or BDNF and miR-210 was unclear; however, VEGF-C expression increased when miR-210 expression was upregulated and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Combined with the results from previous studies, miR-210 may be associated with the increased level of VEGF expression (<xref rid="b52-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b54-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). A high concentration of VEGF in glioma C6 cells promoted the transmigration of human NSCs (ReNcells CX cell lines) (<xref rid="b55-mmr-21-06-2405" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Therefore, miR-210 in BMSCs may further promote NPC migration by increasing the expression of VEGF.</p><p>In summary, the present study successfully isolated BMSCs and NPCs and examined the effects of BMSCs on NPC migration via a Transwell cell migration assay. BMSCs may promote NPC migration; pre-culturing BMSCs for 24 h and co-culturing BMSCs/NPCs for 24 h were the optimal durations of incubation for NPC migration. The BMSCs overexpressing miR-210 may have promoted NPC migration further by increasing VEGF-C expression. These data may provide insight into the mechanism, in which transplanted BMSCs may promote NPC migration to the ischemic focus following cerebral ischemia <italic>in vivo</italic> by increasing miR-210 and VEGF expression; however, further investigation <italic>in vivo</italic> in the future is required. In addition, the mechanism underlying miR-210-mediated regulation of VEGF remains to be elucidated in future studies. The results of the present study may assist in developing new therapeutic regimens for cerebral ischemia. Transplantation of BMSCs, especially the BMSCs overexpressing miR-210 after cerebral ischemia may promote NPC migration to the ischemia foci, which is good for brain damage repair.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The present study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 81100927 and 81671150) and the Chongqing Science and Technology Commission (grant no. cstc2011jjA10079).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FW, acquisition of data, and drafting the manuscript.
