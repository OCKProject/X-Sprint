In recent years, with the improvement of treatment strategy and early detection for BC, the five-year survival of women with BC has improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, due to the high incidence and unclear pathogenesis, the survival rate of BC patients is still not high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is necessary to further study the molecular mechanism underlying BC and explore new targets for BC treatment.</p><p id="Par6">Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are special non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that extensively expressed in eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It has been reported that circRNAs take part in many physiological and pathological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Accumulating studies have demonstrated that the dysregulation of circRNAs participate in the regulation of malignant tumours through competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, circSMARCA5 could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma by sponging miR-17-3p and miR-181b-5p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. CircLARP4 was demonstrated to inhibit gastric cancer cell growth and invasion through regulating the miR-424-5p/LATS1 axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. CircMTO1 could decelerate hepatocellular carcinoma progression via miR-9/p21 axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. All these reports indicated that circRNAs play vital roles in the carcinogenesis of human cancers. More importantly, circKIF4A regulated cell growth and motility by sponging miR-375 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, the functions and underlying mechanisms of circKIF4A in BC are not fully clear.</p><p id="Par7">It is widely accepted that circRNAs can serve as microRNAs (miRNAs) sponges to participate in many physiological and pathophysiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. MiRNAs are a group of small endogenous ncRNAs with about 22 nucleotides which can recognize the 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032; UTR) of target gene to alter gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It has been documented that multiple miRNAs are associated with the development of BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A previous study disclosed that miR-152 repressed BC cell growth and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, our understandings on the roles of miR-152 and its underlying mechanism in BC are still not enough.</p><p id="Par8">Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox&#x000a0;1 (ZEB1) belongs to the ZEB family, and it is closely related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is important for cell metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Furthermore, we determined the level of miR-152 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pcDNA-circKIF4A or si-circKIF4A. The results indicated that miR-152 was markedly downregulated by circKIF4A overexpression, whereas miR-152 expression was significantly upregulated after si-circKIF4A transfection in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h and i). Collectively, circKIF4A directly interacted with miR-152 and suppressed miR-152 expression in BC cells.

It showed that 3&#x02032; UTR of ZEB1 might contain the complementary sequences of miR-152 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). To confirm it, dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed. Our results presented that the luciferase activity was markedly inhibited in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells co-transfected with ZEB1-WT and miR-152, while there was no significant difference in ZEB1-MUT groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b and c). RIP assay presented that the enrichment of ZEB1 was distinctly increased in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with miR-152 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d and e). Moreover, we observed that ZEB1 mRNA was elevated in BC tissues and cells in reference to that in normal tissues and cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>f and g). Subsequently, the protein level of ZEB1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with miR-152, anti-miR-152, circKIF4A, si-circKIF4A or their corresponding controls was measured using western blot assay. The results implicated that miR-152 obviously suppressed ZEB1 expression and miR-152 inhibition significantly increased ZEB1 expression in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>h and i). Overexpression of circKIF4A resulted in a remarked increase of ZEB1 and knockdown of circKIF4A resulted in a significant decrease of ZEB1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>j and k). To sum up, circKIF4A positively regulated ZEB1 expression through targeting miR-152 in BC cells.

Transwell assay indicated that the migration and invasion of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were effectively suppressed by si-circKIF4A transfection, while the effects could be abolished by anti-miR-152 transfection (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b and c). Flow-cytometric analysis indicated that circKIF4A knockdown significantly induced the apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas depletion of miR-152 could partially abolish the effect (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d). Moreover, the increased level of caspase-3 caused by circKIF4A knockdown was partly attenuated by miR-152 inhibition in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e). Thus, we concluded that circKIF4A silencing could decelerate BC cell progression by interacting with miR-152.

Emerging studies indicated that circRNAs play crucial roles in several human cancers, including BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Here, we mainly investigated the roles of circKIF4A and its underlying mechanisms in BC. A previous document revealed that circKIF4A was significantly elevated and circKIF4A inhibition suppressed cell growth and motility in TNBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, our study exhibited that circKIF4A was markedly elevated in BC tissues and cells. CircKIF4A deficiency markedly repressed cell metastasis and promoted apoptosis in BC. Besides, we found caspase-3 was upregulated in BC cells after circKIF4A knockdown. Caspase-3 is an executive molecule, which plays the function of apoptosis in various apoptotic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. These results revealed that circKIF4A played important roles in the progression of BC. Therefore, we speculated that circKIF4A might act as a therapeutic target for BC.</p><p id="Par27">Increasing evidence has demonstrated that circRNAs can function as miRNAs sponges to bind to miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In our research, we found that circKIF4A contained the binding sites for miR-152 and miR-152 was distinctly reduced in BC tissues and cells. It has been verified that miRNAs are dysregulated in several of cancers and act as essential regulators in cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, miR-152 was decreased in some cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Moreover, a previous study showed that miR-152 was obviously reduced in BC, and miR-152 overexpression significantly hampered the metastasis of BC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our study showed that circKIF4A overexpression significantly decreased miR-152 expression, while circKIF4A knockdown significantly increased miR-152 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-152 restored the influences of circKIF4A knockdown on BC cell metastasis and apoptosis.</p><p id="Par28">ZEB1 is an EMT inducing transcription factor, and it is critical for tumor cell invasion and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

In our current study, ZEB1 was a target of miR-152 and circKIF4A upregulated the expression of ZEB1 by inhibiting miR-152 expression in BC cells. Additionally, ZEB1 overexpression abolished the impacts of circKIF4A deficiency on BC cell metastasis and apoptosis.
