    "Kindlin‑2 plays a carcinogenic or tumor‑suppressor role in various tumors. However, its role in cervical cancer remains unclear. In the present study, kindlin‑2 expression was first analyzed using public expression data and clinical specimens. It was revealed that kindlin‑2 was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues, and low expression of kindlin‑2 was associated with poor disease‑free survival. In addition, kindlin‑2 was overexpressed and knocked down in two cell lines to study its effect in cervical cancer cells. The results revealed that kindlin‑2 promoted cell autophagy and inactivated AKT/mTOR signaling. Rescue experiments indicated that the regulation of autophagy by kindlin‑2 was dependent on the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, it was revealed that kindlin‑2 inhibited cell migration, and autophagy was required for this process. Collectively, these findings revealed the role and mechanism of kindlin‑2 in the autophagy and migration of cervical cancer cells."
