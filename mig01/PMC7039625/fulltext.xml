Pathological changes in AAA include chronic inflammatory infiltration, destruction and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM), and degradation of collagen and elastin. In the United States, AAA rupture is the 13th leading cause of death, with an estimated annual death of approximately 15,000 [<xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. According to reports, when AAA ruptures, the mortality rate exceeds 80% [<xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Currently, there is no effective medical treatment to prevent progression or rupture of AAA, and intravascular or open surgical repair is the only medical choice. Therefore, it is urgent to clarify the pathogenesis of AAA and uncover its therapeutic target.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large family and are named for their need for metal ions, such as Zn<sup>2</sup>+ or Ca2+, as cofactors [<xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. The main function of MMPs is to degrade various protein components in the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. In total, 24 members of the MMP family have been identified according to their structure and function and classified into 6 classes according to their substrates: collagenases [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>], gelatinases [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>], stromelysins [<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>], matrilysins [<xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>] and other secretory MMPs. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the media and adventitia of the aortic wall are the main source of MMP-2 [<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. It is now believed that MMP-2 can degrade both elastin and collagen, and by inhibiting MMP-2, AAA could be abolished [<xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>].</p><p>Some studies reported that in the cardiovascular system, transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) family involves in the regulation of pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>], congestive heart failure [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>], systemic hypertension [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>], and pulmonary hypertension [<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. TRPV1 channel is a nonselective cation channel with significant permeability to H<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>, and Mg<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup> plasmas and it plays a significant role in vascular remodeling. However, whether TRPV1 participates in the AAA process is still unclear. We reasoned that this study would argue for, or against that TRPV1 as a therapeutic target in AAA, since recent studies have shown that by activating TRPV1, intracranial arteriole remodeling can be attenuated [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Results</title><p>ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice were infused with angiotensin II (AngII) (1.44 mg/kg/day infused by osmotic minipump) for 4 weeks to induce the AAA model (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(a</xref>)). The incidence of AAA in AngII group was 50%, while no AAA was observed in control group (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(b</xref>)). The diameter of the maximal abdominal aorta was significantly larger than that of the control group (1.355 vs 1.009, P &#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01, <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1(c</xref> and <xref rid="F0001">d</xref>)). More elastin and collagen fragmentations were observed in the AngII group than in the control group (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F0001">c</xref>)). Immunohistochemistry staining showed decreased expression of TRPV1 (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(d</xref>)). RT-PCR and western blotting showed that in AAA tissue, mRNA level and protein expression of TRPV1 were significantly lower (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(a</xref>, <xref rid="F0003">c</xref> and <xref rid="F0003">e</xref>)). On the contrary, MMP-2 was higher than in normal aorta tissue (<xref rid="F0003">Figure 3(b</xref>, <xref rid="F0003">d</xref> and <xref rid="F0003">e</xref>)), which is the marker of AAA [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. In vitro, the mRNA level and protein expression of TRPV1 and MMP-2 showed similar results in VSMCs infused with AngII. However, overexpression of TRPV1 by transfecting adenovirus could decrease MMP-2 level (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(a</xref>-<xref rid="F0004">d, g</xref>)). Furthermore, representative vasoconstrictive proteins such as &#x003b1;-SMA and SM22&#x003b1; were decreased in response to AngII, which could be converted by overexpression of TRPV1 (<xref rid="F0004">Figure 4(e</xref> and <xref rid="F0004">f</xref>)). Cell scrape assay was performed to identify whether the overexpression of TRPV1 can affect the migration of VSMCs in response to AngII. The result showed that in VSMCs infused by AngII, migration was increased while it can be attenuated by overexpression of TRPV1 and down-regulation of TRPV1 promoted the migration (<xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19336950.2020.1730020-F0001</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice were infused with Saline or AngII for 28 d by embedding osmotic minipump subcutaneously (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 per group).

In vitro, TRPV1 expression was downregulated and MMP-2 was upregulated in VSMCs infused by AngII. Overexpression of TRPV1 could inhibit the secretion of MMP-2 and attenuate the down-regulated SM22&#x003b1; and &#x003b1;-SMA caused by AngII infusion. Meanwhile, the migration of VSMCs induced by AngII was also converted by overexpression of TRPV1. In contrast, down-regulation of TRPV1 promoted the migration.</p><p>Nowadays, TRP family has been classified into six subfamilies including vanilloid (TRPV), canonical (TRPC), melastatin (TRPM), polycystin (TRPP), mucoloipin (TRPML) and ankyrin (TRPA), depending on the sequence of amino acids homology [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>]. TRPV1 was believed to have various distributions in organs including heart, liver, lungs, kidney, intestine, brain, uterus, testis, salivary glands, dorsal root ganglia, and sensory neurons [<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024">24</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025">25</xref>]. One study gave experimental evidence that continuous activation of TRPV1 could attenuate atherosclerosis evoked by a high-fat diet. They declared that TRPV1 activation regulates ABCA1/LRP1 expression through calcium-evoked calcineurin- and PKA-dependent mechanisms in VSMC [<xref rid="CIT0026">26</xref>]. Similarly, another study stated that TRPV1 activation attenuated foam cell formation by inducing autophagy in oxLDL-treated VSMCs. Activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin-induced autophagy through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Besides, TRPV1 activation by dietary capsaicin prevented high-salt diet-induced cardiac hypertrophy by ameliorating cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction. TRPV1 activation upregulated sirtuin 3 in vivo, thus protecting mitochondria from dysfunction [<xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. In my study, TRPV1 showed decreased expression in heart tissue from ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice infused with AngII compared with ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice infused with Saline (Figure S1). These results suggested that TRPV1 has a protective effect in cardiovascular diseases. Although one study demonstrated that TRPV1 expression was increased in patients with ascending aortic aneurysm, which seemed to be contradictory with our results [<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>], it should be noted that the origin of VSMCs in the ascending aorta was different from the abdominal aorta [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>]. Nogi M et al. reported that disruption and degradation of medial elastic lamina in the ascending aorta were more severe in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup>SmgGDS<sup>&#x000b1;</sup> mice compared with ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/-</sup> mice after AngII infusion for 4 weeks. However, there was no significant difference in the disruption and degradation of the medial elastic lamina in the abdominal aorta between the two genotypes after AngII infusion [<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. Therefore, it was no surprising to find that TRPV1 expression was decreased in AngII-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm mouse models.</p><p>MMP family played an important role in the initiation of AAA. The main function of MMPs was to degrade various protein components in the extracellular matrix [<xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Besides, MMPs maintained the normal structure and played an important role in the regulation of various soluble factors. Most studies reported that under AngII stimulation, VSMCs changed from contractile phenotype to secretory phenotype, accompanied by increased MMP-2 secretion, which was a significant pathological process of AAA [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>]. VSMCs in the media and adventitia of the aortic wall were the main source of MMP-2. It was now believed that MMP-2 could degrade both elastin and collagen [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Normally, VSMCs had a protective effect on the aortic tissue. VSMCs synthesized collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans. Under the conditions of hypertension, atherosclerosis, or some other vascular diseases that could cause inflammation, VSMCs confined the inflammation to the adventitia to limit proteolysis. Therefore, it was reasonable that the release of proteolytic enzymes, such as MMP-2, might result in disruption of the medial membrane of the aorta and aneurysm formation eventually [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>]. The MT1-MMP/TIMP2/MMP-2 enzyme complex was additional evidence that MMP-2 played a key role in ECM remodeling and medial disruption in AAA [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>]. TRPV1 was reported to have the potential regulatory effect of MMP. Previous studies demonstrated that TRPV1 inhibition could inhibit the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-2 in skin fibroblasts and TRPV1 increased activity is associated with the up-regulation of MMP-2 levels in other models [<xref rid="CIT0032">32</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033">33</xref>]. However, another study concerning myocardial fibrosis stated that TRPV1 activation attenuated pressure overload-induced overexpression of MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13 in Wild-Type mice. This discrepancy might be due to different cell types which need to be elucidated in the future study. In my study, overexpression of TRPV1 could inhibit MMP-2 expression. Up-regulation or down-regulation of TRPV1 has no influence on the expression of MMP-1 (Figure S2).</p><p>The phenotypic regulation of contractile VSMCs was considered to be the key causing of arterial remodeling and played an important role in the formation of AAA [<xref rid="CIT0034">34</xref>]. Consequently, inhibiting the conversion of VSMCs to secretory phenotypes, especially inhibiting the increased MMP-2 secretion in AAA formation was an important treatment strategy. In this study, low TRPV1 expression was detected in the AAA tissue, accompanied by high MMP-2 expression. Besides, elastin and collagen fiber were found degraded in AAA compared with the control group (<xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F0002">c</xref>)). These findings were consistent with in vitro results. In AngII-infused VSMCs, representative vasoconstrictive proteins such as &#x003b1;-SMA and SM22&#x003b1; were upregulated. Our study delineated that overexpression of TRPV1 by using adenovirus inhibited the expression of MMP-2, indicating that TRPV1 had a potential effect to attenuate AAA. The complex role of TRPV1 in AAA progression required further investigation. Meanwhile, reduced SM22&#x003b1; and SMA in AngII-infused VSMCs was converted by overexpression of TRPV1. Migration of VSMCs played a crucial role in AAA formation. Maegdefessel L et al. reported that the migration of VSMCs was increased in both human specimens and animal models of AAA and inhibition of migration may attenuate AAA[<xref rid="CIT0035">35</xref>]. Our study verified that the hypothesis and the migration of VSMCs induced by AngII infusion could be inhibited by TRPV1 overexpression. In summary, our findings suggested that TRPV1 could be a potential effective target for AAA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Animals</bold> All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shengjing Hospital and conducted in accordance with existing guidelines on the care and use of laboratory animals.

Vascular ultrasound (Vevo 2100 apparatus) was performed by using small animal ultrasound system to examine the incidence of AAA and the maximal abdominal aorta in each group.

Monitor heart rate through electrocardiogram system, maintain heart rate at 400&#x02013;500 bpm and keep constant. Firstly, apply the probe on short axis to locate aorta, distinguishing it from vena cava by pulsatile property of the blood vessel.
