Abstract</div> <p>Although microRNAs (miRNAs)-based cancer therapy strategies have been proved to be efficient and superior to chemotherapeutic agents in certain extent, the unstable properties of miRNAs significantly impaired the wide application. Therefore, how to safely deliver the miRNAs to the targeted site of action is the most pivotal step to achieve the ideal treatment effect. In the present work, the miR-128-3p, which is able of inducing chromosomal instability, was loaded into the nanocomplexes developed by the PEG-PDMAEMA (PDMAEMA-NP). By this way, the miR-128-3p was shielded from exposure to various degrading enzymes in bloodstream. Additionally, the PEGylation endowed the PDMAEMA-NP with long time of circulation as demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> by pharmacokinetics investigation. To target and deliver the miR-128-3p to the site of action, a tumor-homing peptide CPKSNNGVC, which specifically targets the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), was decorated on the surface of PDMAEMA-NP. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that more efficient delivery of miR-128-3p to cells or tumor tissues was obtained by the PDMAEMA-NP than plasmid. Additionally, modification of C peptides further enhanced the tumor accumulation of miR-128-3p, and in turn contributed to the stronger tumor growth inhibition effect. Underlying mechanisms study revealed that the miR-128-3p inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and progress of CRC tissues through silence of the activity of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathway. By this way, the chemotherapy effect of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) was dramatically improved after co-treating the cells with miR-128-3p formulations.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>As one of the prevalent cancer types, the colorectal cancer (CRC) has been the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality (Siegel et al., <a href="#CIT0030">2014</a>). As previous statistical data revealed that nearly 1.4 million new patients were detected with CRC in a year and about 0.7 million death cases were reported due to the progress or relapse of CRC (Arnold et al., <a href="#CIT0004">2017</a>; Araghi et al., <a href="#CIT0002">2019</a>). Unfortunately, the concealed characteristics, late diagnosis, and rapid progression of CRC generally paved an obstacle in the achievement of satisfactory treatment effect (Qiu et al., <a href="#CIT0027">2016</a>; Lee et al., <a href="#CIT0019">2017</a>; Armelao et al., <a href="#CIT0003">2018</a>). Additionally, the emergence of drug-resistance due to multiple mechanisms resulted in treatment failure in more than 90% patients (Rihawi et al., <a href="#CIT0028">2015</a>).</p> <p>As the most important small and non-coding regulatory molecules, microRNAs (miRNAs) are able of mediating a wide array of signaling pathways, which are responsible for a series of cellular process (Fabian &amp;amp; Sonenberg, 2012; Choi et al., <a href="#CIT0009">2013</a>). However, the aberrant regulation of miRNA, mainly due to genetic or epigenetic mechanisms, was closely related to tumorigenesis, progression, invasion and metastasis of many cancer types (Popov et al., <a href="#CIT0026">2015</a>; Petrovic et al., <a href="#CIT0024">2017</a>). Furthermore, it was reported that counterbalancing the function of increased or decreased miRNAs has shown excellent anticancer effect (Liu et al., <a href="#CIT0021">2017</a>). Among a series of miRNAs, miR-128-3p has been identified to speed up cell cycle arrest and chromosomal instability by suppressing the spectrin alpha and non-erythrocytic 1 (Zhang et al., <a href="#CIT0033">2016</a>). It was also indicated that miR-128-3p was intimately associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (Guo et al., <a href="#CIT0014">2018</a>) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Rzepiel et al., <a href="#CIT0029">2019</a>).</p> <p>However, the major challenge of using miRNA for cancer treatment is the low circulation half-life of naked synthetic small RNAs after they are injected into the bloodstream mainly due to the abundant nucleases (Fernandez-Piñeiro et al., <a href="#CIT0012">2017</a>). A viable strategy to circumvent the rapid intravascular degradation is to shield the miRNAs by enclosing them into nanocarriers (Fernandez-Piñeiro et al., <a href="#CIT0012">2017</a>). Additionally, nanocarriers can be designed to enhance the drug biodistribution, accumulation kinetics, and sustained release profile by decoration with tumor-homing peptides or aptamers (He et al., <a href="#CIT0015">2018</a>). Such targeted delivery strategy was supposed to be able of offering the possibility to increase the therapeutic efficacy of intravenously administered anticancer formulations and minimizing adverse effects in healthy organs simultaneously (Xiao et al., <a href="#CIT0031">2018</a>).</p> <p>In the present study, a PDMAEMA nanocomplex loaded with miR-128-3p (PDMAEMA-NP) was designed for combating the progress of CRC. To achieve the goal of targeting delivery of miRNAs to tumor sites, a recently developed tumor homing-peptide CPKSNNGVC (C peptide for short) was further decorated on the surface of PDMAEMA-NP (CPDMAEMA-NP). The CPKSNNGVC was designed to specifically target the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) which was overexpressed in series of CRC cells, such as the Caco-2, HCT 116, and HCT-15, while not the normal non-cancer cells (Ferreira et al., <a href="#CIT0013">2019</a>). In this case, the developed CPDMAEMA-NP was supposed to be CRC-recognizable and stable enough to deliver the miR-128-3p to the sites of action.</p> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

MiR-128-3p, has significant role in speeding up of cell cycle arrest and chromosomal instability, was demonstrated to be an oncogene in malignancies such as acute leukemia, breast cancer, and lung cancer (Cai et al., <a href="#CIT0008">2017</a>; Block et al., <a href="#CIT0007">2018</a>; Guo et al., <a href="#CIT0014">2018</a>). Nevertheless, tumor suppressive functions of miR-128-3p were also proved in other cancer types such as the human esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma and hepatoma carcinoma cell (Yao et al., <a href="#CIT0032">2015</a>; Guo et al., <a href="#CIT0014">2018</a>). In the present study, scarce expression of miR-128-3p was detected in CRC tissues obtained from 32 patients with late stage of CRC. Additionally, insufficient activity of miR-128-3p was further confirmed in a series of CRC cells while obvious higher level of miR-128-3p was detectable in the corresponding normal cells. The results preliminarily indicated the negative role of miR-128-3p in the developed of CRC. Such hypothesis was confirmed by our further studies with increasing the levels of miR-128-3p significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells and progress of CRC tissues. Moreover, the up-regulation of miR-128-3p also improved the sensitivity of CRC cells or tissues to 5-Fu treatment.</p> <p>The miRNAs promotes or inhibition tumorigenesis and metastasis mainly through regulation of the gene mutation and/or abnormal activation of various signal pathways (Kager et al., <a href="#CIT0017">2017</a>). NPTX1 has been reported to be intimately associated with a wide range of cancers and its aberrant activation was closely related to tumorigenesis and progress (Mori et al., <a href="#CIT0023">2011</a>). Our studies revealed that elevation of miR-128-3p signally down-regulated the NPTX1 levels in CRC cells. PI3K/AKT has been demonstrated to be one of the most pivotal regulator of tumorigenesis and progress of many cancer types (Faes &amp;amp; Dormond, 2015). Previous studies have proved that excessive activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway was closely related to proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells (Alqurashi et al., <a href="#CIT0001">2018</a>). It was reported that the NPTX1 regulated the development and growth of cancers mainly through activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Huo et al., <a href="#CIT0016">2019</a>). In the present study, the effect of miR-128-3p on the regulation of PI3K/AKT signaling was therefore investigated. As demonstrated that up-regulation of the miR-128-3p levels resulted in silence of PI3K/AKT signal in CRC cells and tissues. In contrast, insufficient expression of miR-128-3p in the untreated CRC cells leaded to abnormal activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, which in turn contributed to high rate of proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, our studies also revealed that the activity of MEK/ERK pathway was simultaneously inhibited after elevation of the miR-128-3p levels. The MEK/ERK represents another critical signaling pathway in colorectal and melanoma cancer progression by regulating cancer cell proliferation and survival (Liu et al., <a href="#CIT0020">2014</a>). Based on this, the miR-128-3p could be the dual MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT cell signaling pathway inhibitor through targeting the NPTX1.</p> <p>Although the miRNA has been attractive for therapeutic use due to its high efficiency and easily synthesized, the unstable properties and low circulation half-life significantly impaired the widely application (Rzepiel et al., <a href="#CIT0029">2019</a>). As demonstrated in the present study, delivery of miR-128-3p by plasmid exhibited extremely instable <i>in vivo</i> with a rapid metabolism within 2 h. To avoid premature degradation and prolong the circulation time of miRNAs in bloodstream, the miRNAs should be shield enough and escaped from filtered out by kidney. In our study, to achieve that goal, the miR-128-3p was loaded into the inner core of PDMAEMA-NP. By this way, the miR-128-3p was shielded from exposure to various degrading enzymes in bloodstream. Moreover, the terminal of PDMAEMA was functionalized with PEG chains, which was favorable for long time of circulation by minimizing nonspecific interactions of nanoparticles with serum proteins (Fernandez-Piñeiro et al., <a href="#CIT0012">2017</a>). Pharmacokinetics investigation revealed that the circulation time of miR-128-3p was dramatically prolonged after it was delivered by PDMAEMA nanocomplexes.</p> <p>Recently, ligand-based active targeting strategy has been widely developed for its excellent capacity of improving drug delivery efficiency (Bazak et al., <a href="#CIT0005">2015</a>). By utilizing these specific ligands, which are able of targeting specific receptors that were over-expressed on cancer cells, the accumulation of drugs in tumor tissues could be signally enhanced and unwanted side-effects could be markedly down-regulated as well (Zhong et al., <a href="#CIT0034">2019</a>). The C peptide, with the sequence of CPKSNNGVC, was a recently developed peptide designed to specifically target the MCT1 (Ferreira et al., <a href="#CIT0013">2019</a>). MCT1 plays significant role in catalyzing of the proton-linked movement of many monocarboxylates and promotion of lactate influx into tumor cells, which finally contributed to tumor metabolism (Benjamin et al., <a href="#CIT0006">2018</a>). Additionally, increased MCT1 expression was closely related to the disease progression and prognosis in a wide range of human malignancies (Miranda-Gonçalves et al., <a href="#CIT0022">2013</a>). Previous studies have demonstrated that aberrant expression of MCT1 was detectable in CRC while not the normal tissues (Pinheiro et al., <a href="#CIT0025">2008</a>). Based on this, the MCT1 might be an ideal target for realize tumor targeting therapy. In our study, the surface of PDMAEMA-NP was decorated with the C peptide. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that modification of C peptide markedly enhanced CRC cells and/or tissues accumulation of miR-128-3p, which in turn leaded to the strongest anti-tumor effect. Moreover, the C peptides mediated drug delivery also leaded to more safety to the normal organs mainly due to largely reduced the unwanted accumulation of drugs at the nonactive sites.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that elevation of the miR-128-3p level resulted in obvious inhibition effect on the growth, migration, and invasion of CRC. Further underlying mechanisms studies revealed that miR-128-3p down-regulated the deteriorate rate of CRC through simultaneously silencing the activity of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathway. To safely and efficiently deliver the miR-128-3p <i>in vivo</i>, miR-128-3p was loaded in to the developed PDMAEMA-NP and decorated with CRC-homing peptide for active targeting therapy. The results confirmed that the CPDMAEMA-NP not only contributed to the most efficient anti-tumor effect, but also leaded to the least toxic side effects.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="disclosurestatement" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
