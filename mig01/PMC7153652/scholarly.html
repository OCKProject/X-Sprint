ABSTRACT</div> <p>DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinases for collagen and an adverse prognostic factor in primary and metastatic tumors.Despite this, DDR1 signaling and its functional consequences in tumor development remain unclear. RT-PCR and Western blot show that A375, colon carcinoma HT29 and liver carcinoma SK-HEP human cell lines express functional DDR1 that phosphorylates in response to collagen type I. Chemical inhibition of DDR1 phosphorylation or DDR1 mRNA silencing reduced AKT and ERK phosphorylation, expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1, Ki67 and secretion of MMP9. DDR1 silenced cells showed reduced adhesion to collagen type I, MMP-dependent invasion, and chemotactic and proliferative responses to collagen type I. Our work indicates an essential role for DDR1 signaling in key prometastatic features of collagen type I in human carcinoma cells.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) belongs to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases for collagen [<a href="#CIT0001">1</a>–<a href="#CIT0003">3</a>]. The elevated expression of DDR1 in fast-growing invasive tumors and associated metastases has dramatically increased the researcher´s attention in the pathological implication of DDR1 in cancer [<a href="#CIT0004">4</a>–<a href="#CIT0006">6</a>]. Several <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies pin-points DDR1 as a significant promoter of tumor cell invasion. Despite this, the functional consequences of DDR1 signaling are far from being understood. Further use of antitumor therapies based on DDR1 inhibition requires a more in-depth knowledge of cell-specific DDR1 expression and signaling, the mechanisms that activate its signaling, and its functional implication in tumor growth and dissemination. We have previously demonstrated a pro-metastatic role for discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) in A375 melanoma, HT29 colon carcinoma, and SK-HEP hepatocarcinoma cell lines [<a href="#CIT0007">7</a>]. In this work we utilize two approaches to inhibit DDR1 signaling in those tumor cell lines: chemical inhibition and mRNA silencing. We analyze the effect of DDR1 inhibition in the expression of key signaling mediators for tumor development and analyze the role of DDR1 in pro-invasive cellular functions in response to collagen type I.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Human A375, HT29 AND SK-HEP tumor cells express functional DDR1</div> <p>A375, HT29 and SK-HEP are highly invasive carcinoma cell lines from skin, colon and liver, respectively. We have previously observed that these cell lines are able to metastasize the liver, were tumor development is collagen-dependent by a mechanism partially dependent on DDR2, the other member of the DDR family [<a href="#CIT0007">7</a>].</p> <p>First, we utilized Flow Cytometry to measure the percentage of cells that expressed the receptor under sub-confluent culture conditions, and the fluorescence intensity per cell, that correlates with receptor density (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1a</a>). MDA-MB231 and MDA-453 were used as a positive control for DDR1 expression in tumor cells, while LX2 cells were used as a positive control for non-tumoral DDR1. DDR1 was detected in all analyzed samples. An average 50% of A375 and SK-HEP cells expressed detectable levels of DDR1, similar to those observed in MDA-MB231 cells, with an average fluorescence intensity of 150AU per DDR1-expressing cell. More than 70% of HT29 cells, MDA-MB453 and LX2 cells showed positive staining, with an average 340AU of fluorescence per DDR1-expressing cells. Next, we studied DDR1 mRNA expression in the three tumor cell lines (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1b</a>). As expected from the flow cytometry data, all cell lines expressed DDR1 mRNA. DDR1 mRNA levels drastically variate between tumor cell lines. A375 cells expressed the highest amount of DDR1 mRNA, similar to that of MDA-MB435, while DDR1 mRNA levels in HT29 and SK-HEP were similar to that of MDA-MB231 and LX2 cells. The discrepancies between mRNA expression and protein expression may indicate that the balance of the processes of production and decay that controls the steady-state levels of DDR1mRNA and/or DDR1 protein is cell type-specific. Finally, we confirm the presence of DDR1 in the lysates of tumor cells cultured in the presence of exogenous collagen I (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1c</a>,d). Western blot against human DDR1 showed a single band of ~125KDa. As previously reported in human hepatoma Huh7 cells [<a href="#CIT0008">8</a>], tumor DDR1 appeared constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of exogenous collagen. Maximal phosphorylation rates was observed in HT29 cells. Addition of soluble collagen I further phosphorylates DDR1 in the A375, HT29 and SK-HEP cells by an average 2-fold increase compared to basal phosphorylation. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/19336918.2020.1733892-F0001"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1.</span></a></div>   <p><b>DDR1 is expressed and phosphorylated in human A375, HT29 and SK-HEP tumor cell lines</b>.

Cultured human A375, HT29 and SK-HEP tumor cells produce collagen I</div> <p>Western blot analysis of supernatants from A375, HT29 and SK-HEP tumor cells cultures revealed the presence of a band corresponding to pro-collagen I (<a href="#F0002">Figure 2a</a>,b). In order to test if the band corresponded to collagen, HT29 cells were cultured in the presence of the collagen synthesis inhibitor cis4-hidroxy-L-proline under conditions were no other sources of collagen were provided to the cell cultures. As a result, the band was reduced by an 85% (<a href="#F0002">Figure 2c</a>,d), indicating that at least an 85% of the protein detected in the bands corresponded to endogenously produced collagen. Western blot also detected intracellular collagens (<a href="#F0002">Figure 2e</a>,f). Collagen I appears as a major collagen expressed by the tumor cells, compared to expression of collagens II and VII. These results may indicate DDR1 phosphorylation in the tumor cells is triggered by exogenous, but also by endogenous collagen I. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/19336918.2020.1733892-F0002"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2.</span></a></div>   <p><b>Collagen type I is a major collagen secreted by A375, HT29 and SK-HEP cells</b>.

To reduce DDR1 phosphorylation, tumor cells were treated with the specific DDR1 inhibitor DDR1-IN-1.

MMP9 is a key metalloproteinase for extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation during tumor invasion. MMP9 was reduced by ~75% in low DDR1 phosphorylated A375 and SK-HEP cells compared to control ones. DDR1 phosphorylation levels did not affected MMP9 expression in HT29 cells. While inhibition of DDR1 phosphorylation correlates with an ~75% reduction in AKT phosphorylation in A375 and HT29 cells, no significant effect was observed in SK-HEP hepatoma cells.

DDR1 silencing reduces the adhesion capacity of human tumor cells to collagen I</div> <p>The ability of a tumor cell to adhere to collagen rapidly and firmly is a crucial event in tumor cell invasion of the surrounding tissue.

Discussion</div> <p>In this work, we utilize three human tumor cell lines and two independent approaches to characterize the <i>in vitro</i> implication of DDR1 in tumor malignancy through the analysis of tumor responses to collagen I. The first approach utilized a highly selective pharmacological inhibitor for DDR1-dependent signal transduction. The second one is based on DDR1 mRNA silencing. Both approaches demonstrate that DDR1 mediates invasive characteristic such as tumor cell adhesion, proliferation, migration and ECM degradation. An alternative strategy to strength the data could have been the use of a complementary set of siRNA against DDR1.</p> <p>Blockage of DDR1 expression or phosphorylation in the tumor cells promote changes in a panel of invasion-related proteins, selected from a differential genome array data of liver myofibroblast submitted or not to temporary DDR1 silencing (Romayor et al, manuscript in preparation). We chose ICAM1 and VCAM1, two cell-cell adhesion molecules required for the transmigration step of tumor metastasis [<a href="#CIT0013">13</a>–<a href="#CIT0015">15</a>]. VCAM1 expression depends on DDR1 phosphorylation in macrophages [<a href="#CIT0016">16</a>].</p> <p>Adhesion of SK-HEP-1 cells to the basal membrane and ECM is mediated by ICAM1 activation [<a href="#CIT0017">17</a>]. In this work, we established a direct correlation between DDR1 phosphorylation and tumor cell expression of ICAM1 and VCAM1.</p> <p>We also studied the role of DDR1 in the expression of MMP9, a key regulator of ECM remodeling implicated in tumor invasion through the collagenous microenvironment and in tumor growth [<a href="#CIT0018">18</a>,<a href="#CIT0019">19</a>]. DDR1 mediates MMP9 induced by native type IV collagen in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [<a href="#CIT0020">20</a>]. Our work demonstrated that collagen type I also induces DDR1 mediated synthesis of MMP9 in tumor cells. Finally, we assayed two major downstream effectors of tyrosine kinase receptors, AKT and ERK [<a href="#CIT0021">21</a>]. Our data indicates that DDR1 signaling is a major source of AKT and ERK phosphorylation in tumor cells.</p> <p>Tumor colonization progress as tumor cells migrates in response to chemotactic factors matrix metalloproteinases provided by the tumor microenvironment to degrade the natural barriers such as the basal membrane or ECM [<a href="#CIT0022">22</a>]. In this work, we show that chemical inhibition of MMPs strongly reduces A375 tumor cell invasive migration and that blockage of DDR1 expression reduces tumor cell synthesis of MMP9, while it also reduces proliferation and migration. MMPs facilitate tumor cell invasion and metastasis. As an MMP superfamily member, MMP2 and 9 can degrade the proteins of the ECM of cancer cells, and they can also promote metastatic tumor cells to penetrate the basal membrane, leading to invasion and metastasis.</p> <p>During tumor dissemination, circulating tumor cells must adhere to and confront a collagenous stroma endowed with pro-adhesive but anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties [<a href="#CIT0023">23</a>,<a href="#CIT0024">24</a>]. DDR1 promotes adhesion to collagen of a variety of malignant cells, including pituitary adenoma, glioma, and hepatoma cells [<a href="#CIT0024">24</a>]. Opposed results were obtained by Valencia and cols using H460 lung carcinoma cells, indication that adhesion is a complex process as a result of multiple DDR1-dependent and independent pathways. Our results indicate that phosphorylated DDR1 mediates the initial adhesion of A375, HT29, and SK-HEP to type I collagen. DDR1 mediation of cell adhesion to collagen gene may also be independent of DDR1 kinase domains, as recently demonstrated [<a href="#CIT0025">25</a>]. Finally, DDR1 may also affect the ability of other collagen receptors to promote cell adhesion, although it may not be through DDR1-DDR2 interactions [<a href="#CIT0025">25</a>].</p> <p>Once adhered, tumor cells must proliferate. In this work, we found that DDR1 mediates proliferation in a collagenous culture setting of the three tested tumor cell lines. Furthermore, we found a direct correlation between DDR1 silencing and the levels of phosphorylated AKT and ERK. AKT and ERK signaling are two pro-survival molecules in tumor cells under genotoxic stress, but their role in the proliferation or survival of tumor cells under favorable conditions remains unknown. While several adaptor proteins have been identified that bind DDR1 in response to collagen stimulation, the exact DDR1 signaling pathway elicited to promote a cell function may be significantly cell-specific. Furthermore, DDR1 inhibitors may reduce DDR1 signals through only one of them. For example, DDR1 promotes cell migration through ERK signaling in lymphocytes [<a href="#CIT0026">26</a>], but not in human lung fibroblast [<a href="#CIT0027">27</a>].</p> <p>In this work, we address whether DDR1 phosphorylation is stromal-dependent or may also depend on endogenous collagen secretion. The second hypothesis arises from the fact that the three carcinoma cells secrete collagen type I to the medium. While this result is pending of further analysis by mass spectrometry, it is tempting to say that endogenous collagen produces continuous DDR1 phosphorylation and signaling in these tumor cells, which may indicate a potential positive loop between DDR1 signaling and collagen type I. Alternatively, other collagen receptors may result altered in response to DDR1 silencing. Integrins are altered in DDR1 knock out HEK 293 cells [<a href="#CIT0010">10</a>]. Also, we have previously demonstrated that A375, HT29, and SK-HEP cells express functional DDR2, the other member of the DDR family [<a href="#CIT0007">7</a>]. Finally, DDR1 and DDR2 physical interaction lead to signaling interconnection [<a href="#CIT0025">25</a>]. Whether the same mechanism acts in tumor cells remains unknown.</p> <p>The <i>in vitro</i> results presented in this work open the door for future <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> experiments to confirm its functional relevance. For example, it would be relevant to analyze tumor responses in conditions that more closely resembles the in vivo situation such as culture in 3D collagen gels.</p> </div> <div class="materialandmethods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
