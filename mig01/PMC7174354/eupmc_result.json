    "This study sought to investigate the biological effects of specific MIF inhibitor, ISO-1, on the proliferation, migration and invasion of PANC-1 human pancreatic cells in vitro, and on tumour growth in a xenograft tumour model in vivo. The effect of ISO-1 on PANC-1 cell proliferation was examined using CCK-8 cell proliferation assay. The effect of ISO-1 on collective cell migration and recolonization of PANC-1 cells was evaluated using the cell-wound closure migration assay. The effect of ISO-1 on the migration and invasion of individual PANC-1 cells in a 3-dimensional environment in response to a chemo-attractant was investigated through the use of Transwell migration/invasion assays. Quantitative real time PCR and western blot analyses were employed to investigate the effects of ISO-1 on MIF, NF-κB p65 and TNF-α mRNA and protein expression respectively. Finally, a xenograft tumor model in BALB/c nude mice were used to assess the in vivo effects of ISO-1 on PANC-1-induced tumor growth. We found high expression of MIF in pancreatic cancer tissues. We demonstrated that ISO-1 exerts anti-cancer effects on PANC-1 cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro, and inhibited PANC-1 cell-induced tumour growth in xenograft mice in vivo. Our data suggests that ISO-1 and its derivative may have potential therapeutic applications in pancreatic cancer."
