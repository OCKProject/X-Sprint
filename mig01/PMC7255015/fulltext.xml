Mechanistically, we discover that CD82 glycosylation is pivotal to disrupt integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-mediated cellular adhesion to the abundant extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Thereby the glycosylated CD82 inhibits the integrin signaling pathway responsible for the induction of the cytoskeleton rearrangements required for cellular migration. Furthermore, we reveal that the glycosyltransferase MGAT3 is responsible for CD82 glycosylation in ovarian cancer cells. Metastatic ovarian cancers express reduced levels of MGAT3 which in turn may result in impaired CD82 glycosylation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: Our work implicates a pathway for ovarian cancers metastasis regulation via MGAT3 mediated glycosylation of tetraspanin CD82 at asparagine 157.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ovarian cancer</kwd><kwd>Metastasis</kwd><kwd>Glycosylation</kwd><kwd>CD82</kwd><kwd>Exosomes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ovarian cancer is a frequent gynecological malignancy characterized by a high rate of metastasis and lethality. Differently from other kind of tumors, ovarian cancer only rarely metastasizes through the vasculature, but it rather invades the adjacent tissues or spreads to the distal organs through passive peritoneal dissemination and it is often associated with ascites formation <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The members of integrin family of transmembrane cellular receptors mediate cellular adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and play crucial roles in the transmission of intracellular signals required for cellular migration.</p><p>Cell migration is orchestrated by a highly elaborate complex of molecular pathways, which promotes rapid turnover of the focal adhesion proteins and complex dynamic changes in the cytoskeleton structure, such as the formation of stress fibers and assembly of other specialized structures. Binding of integrins to ECM induces integrin clustering, which in turn leads to the recruitment of cytosolic associated proteins such as the focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Upon recruitment and subsequent autophosphorylation, FAK promotes the phosphorylation of downstream targets, which control the signaling cascade involved in cell migration <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Therefore, integrin-mediated signaling plays an important role in the initiation and establishment of metastasis.</p><p>Within the last decade, tetraspanins have been recognized to interfere with cancer metastasis without affecting the growth of the primary tumor. Different studies demonstrated that tetraspanins can directly or indirectly bind to integrins and modulate the activation of the molecular pathway downstream to these receptors <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. CD82, also known as KAI1, is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily and has been identified as a potent inhibitor of cancer metastasis. Consistently, downregulation of CD82 in different metastatic cancers as compared to primary tumors was reported <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Proteomics-based studies demonstrated that CD82 is glycosylated at three specific residues: Asn129, Asn157 and Asn198, which are located in the extracellular loop (ECL2) domain <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. However, the role of CD82 post-translational modification and its impact on ovarian cancer metastasis remain largely uncharacterized.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that glycosylation of CD82 at Asn157 is fundamental to ensure CD82-mediated inhibition of ovarian cancer cell migration and metastasis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Mechanistically, we show that CD82 glycosylation at Asn157 is required for efficient binding to integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and subsequent disruption of the integrin-based cell adhesion to fibronectin. We further uncovered a previously undescribed mechanism that MGAT3 is a critical glycosyltransferase, which promotes CD82 glycosylation in ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, MGAT3 is significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer metastasis that contributes at least in part to provoke low glycosylation of CD82.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>Human ovarian cancer cell lines ES2 and SKOV3 were purchased from ATCC and cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

However, the role of CD82 in ovarian cancer metastasis has not been investigated. We explored CD82 expression using The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). No significant changes of CD82 expression were found at different stages of ovarian cancer (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A</bold>). Moreover, no association between CD82 expression and lymphovascular invasion was observed (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B</bold>). The expression of CD82 in human biopsies from primary and metastatic ovarian cancers was analyzed using IHC. We did not observe any significant change in CD82 expression in ovarian metastatic and paired primary tumors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C</bold>, <bold>S1A</bold>). Interestingly, western blotting data indicate that CD82 mainly detected at around 55 kDa in primary tumors, while a reduction of 55 kDa and a significant increase of smaller between 35 and 55 kDa detected in metastatic tissues (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D</bold>, <bold>S1B</bold>). The mRNA levels of CD82 were no different in metastatic and primary tumors by real time PCR detection (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>C</bold>).</p><p>Furthermore, expression pattern of CD82 in lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer cell lines revealed a molecular weight ranging between 35 and 55 kDa (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E</bold>). It was previously demonstrated that tetraspanins are highly glycosylated proteins <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. We subjected protein lysates derived from ES2 and SKVO3 ovarian cancer cell lines to treatment with recombinant glycosidase (peptide-N-glycosidase F; PNGase F) to remove the presumed N-glycan structures. CD82 protein was detected at around 30 kDa in PNGase F treatment, while was detected at 55 kDa in untreated cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F</bold>).</p><p>Former proteomics based-analysis identified three major residues in the EC2 domain of CD82, which are N-glycosylated: Asn129, Asn157 and Asn198 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G</bold>) <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. To prove whether the glycosylation is caused the separation pattern of CD82 in western blotting, we generated CD82 glycosylation deficient point mutants. Each asparagine (N) was substituted with glutamine (Q) to generate the single mutants N129Q, N157Q, N198Q, the double mutant N157/198Q and the triple mutant N129/N157/N198Q (3NQ) (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G</bold>). The five glycosylation deficient mutants and the CD82 were stably overexpressed in ES2 cells using a lentiviral-based system. The subsequent western blot analysis revealed that the abolishment of single or combined glycosylation residues generated protein bands at the lower molecular weight <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>H)</bold>. The triple mutant 3NQ could be mainly detected at around 30 kDa. This molecular weight was also obtained with all glycosylation mutants upon treatment with PNGase F (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>H</bold>). These results were confirmed by analysis of the glycosylation deficient mutants overexpressed in SKOV3 cells (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>A</bold>). All these data corroborate that CD82 is highly glycosylated in ovarian cancer cells and indicate that the reduction of 55 kDa CD82 and the concomitant increase in smaller molecular weight fractions in metastatic ovarian cancer can be attributed to impaired CD82 glycosylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Glycosylation of CD82 at Asn157 impairs ovarian cancer cells migration <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We next investigated whether the glycosylation of CD82 has any impact on ovarian cancer cells migration. A transwell migration assay demonstrated that CD82, N129Q and N198Q mutants significantly reduced migration of ES2 cells. In contrast, the N157Q mutant, the double mutant N157/198Q and the triple mutant 3NQ did not exert any significant effect on migration of ES2 cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A</bold>). Similar results were observed in scratch assay <bold>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B</bold>). Consistent results were also obtained in SKOV3 stable cell lines (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>D-E</bold>). Taken together these data strongly imply that the glycosylation of CD82 at N157 is sufficient for CD82-mediated inhibition of ovarian cancer cells migration. To provide a more exact assessment of the migratory potential, we analyzed the migration distance of control, CD82 and N157Q mutant cells using time-lapse assay. As demonstrated in <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C</bold> CD82 significantly reduced the migration of ES2 cells whereas no effect was caused by N157Q mutant. The cell migration videos and the relative quantification of the migration velocity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Videos S1</xref>A-C</bold>, <bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D</bold>) further confirmed these data.</p><p>Exosomes were isolated from control, CD82 and N157Q mutant cells. The characteristics were assessed using Alix and TSG101 as exosome markers and nucleoporin and GM130 as negative controls (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E</bold>, <bold>S2B</bold>). In addition, we confirmed the localization of CD82 in exosomes using immunoelectron microscopy (IEM) and limited trypsin digestion assay (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>C</bold>, <bold>S2G</bold>). Next, we treated ES2 cells with exosomes, which were pre-labeled with Dir dye and confirmed the internalization of exogenous exosomal CD82 by immunofluorescence using anti-Flag antibody (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>H</bold>). CD82-enriched exosomes significantly impaired ovarian cancer cell migration in contrast to exosomes derived from control and N157Q mutant cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>F, S2F</bold>). Altogether these data demonstrate that CD82 glycosylation at N157 is a determinant post-translational modification responsible for CD82-mediated inhibition of ovarian cancer cell migration <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>CD82 glycosylation at Asn157 impairs fibronectin-integrin pathway</title><p>We were further interested to get more insight into the molecular mechanism by which CD82 glycosylation at Asn157 inhibits ovarian cancer cells migration. Different studies demonstrated that tetraspanins function as scaffolding proteins for membrane receptors such as integrins, modulating thereby the activation of downstream signaling pathways <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Integrins including &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 play pivotal roles in the anchorage of cells to the ECM especially through the binding to the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The binding of integrins to fibronectin is in turn essential for the transmission of intracellular signals, which promote cellular migration and motility <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. Since previous studies suggested that CD82 suppresses cell migration by association with integrins and disruption of the fibronectin-integrin axis <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, we reasoned that the glycosylation of CD82 at N157 might impact its interaction with integrins. Consistently with previous reports, we could show in co-immunoprecipitation experiments that Flag-tagged CD82 stably expressed in ES2 cells interacts with endogenous integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 but does not interact with the &#x003b2;4 subunit (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A</bold>). Noticeably, we could further demonstrate that the glycosylation deficient mutant N157Q, but not the N198Q mutant, displayed an impaired capacity of binding to integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, indicating that the glycosylation of CD82 at Asn157 is required for the efficient interaction of CD82 with integrins (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A</bold>).</p><p>Since integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 contributes to cellular adhesion to fibronectin, we wondered whether the N157 glycosylated CD82 might inhibit the adhesion of ovarian cancer cells by disrupting the integrin-fibronectin interaction. Indeed, ES2 cells overexpressing CD82 possess an impaired capacity to adhere to fibronectin coated plates in contrast to control and N157Q overexpressing cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B</bold>,<bold> S3A</bold>). We could further confirm the inhibitory function of N157 glycosylation on cell adhesion using exosomes. Exosomes enriched in CD82 significantly inhibited ovarian cancer cells adhesion in contrast to control and N157Q enriched exosomes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>B</bold>). To univocally demonstrate that CD82 glycosylation at Asn157 is responsible for the disruption of the integrin-fibronectin interaction, we assessed this interaction in presence of CD82 and the N157Q and N198Q mutants. Since the interaction between integrins and fibronectin is pivotal for the recruitment of cytosolic integrin-binding adaptor proteins such as FAK and Talin <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, we also estimated the amount of FAK and Talin co-immunoprecipitated with integrin &#x003b2;1. A significantly reduced interaction of these molecules with integrin &#x003b2;1 in ES2 cells overexpressing CD82 and N198Q mutant but not in control and N157Q lent an additional support for the proposed inhibitory role of Asn157 glycosylation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C</bold>). Consistently, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using anti-integrin &#x003b1;5 antibody demonstrated a dramatic increase in the association of integrin &#x003b1;5 with FAK and Talin in ES2 cells overexpressing the glycosylation deficient N157Q mutant as compared with CD82 and N198Q mutant overexpressing cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D</bold>).</p><p>Binding of integrins to fibronectin induces the recruitment and also phosphorylation of FAK, which in turn activates the integrin downstream pathway leading to the phosphorylation of adaptor proteins such as Src and Paxillin <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. To further confirm that the glycosylation of CD82 contributes to diminished activation of the integrin pathway, we analyzed the phosphorylation levels of FAK and Src in stably transfected ES2 cells upon treatment with fibronectin. As expected, cells overexpressing CD82 displayed a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of FAK and Src. While FAK and Src phosphorylation was clearly induced in response to fibronectin in control and N157Q mutant cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>E</bold>). Consistently, a reduced phosphorylation of another down-stream integrin target, Paxillin, was observed in CD82 but not N157Q mutant overexpressing cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F</bold>). Since the interaction of integrin with fibronectin increases the recruitment of FAK and Paxillin to the focal adhesions, the subcellular localization of these molecules was estimated. In agreement with our expectations, FAK and Paxillin were mainly distributed at the cellular periphery in control and N157Q mutant expressing cells, while in CD82 overexpressing cells they were constricted rather to the perinuclear space (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>G-H</bold>, <bold>S3C</bold>).</p><p>Moreover, since the generation of driving forces required for cellular migration results in cellular spreading, we evaluated the impact of CD82 glycosylation on the spreading capacity of ovarian cancer cell lines. In agreement with our assumption, CD82 overexpressing cells possess less spreading capacity as compared with control ES cells or N157Q mutant cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A</bold>). Because activation of integrin pathway has been connected to the formation of stress fibers, we further analyzed the F-actin organization. F-actin organization mainly produce and transmit mechanical tension required for cellular migration <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. In fact, overexpression of CD82 but not N157Q mutant strongly inhibited stress fiber formation in ovarian cancer cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>B</bold>,<bold> S3D</bold>).</p><p>Since it is known that fibronectin-derived Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif-containing peptides can abolish the association of integrin &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 to fibronectin by competitive inhibition and therefore inhibit down-stream cellular events <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, we analyzed the adhesion capacity of control, CD82 and N157Q mutant overexpressing cells on fibronectin coated plates upon treatment with RGD motif-containing peptides (RGDs) or in presence of BSA as a negative control. Noticeably, RGDs treatment strongly impaired cell adhesion in all cells tested (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C</bold>,<bold> S3E</bold>). However, while a reduced adhesion capacity was apparent in ES2 cells overexpressing CD82 upon treatment with BSA no further statistically significant differences were detected between the different cell lines after incubation with RGDs (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C</bold>, <bold>S3E</bold>). This finding strongly suggests that CD82 interrupts integrin-fibronectin contact efficiently enough to exclude the further interference by RGDs. Next, we estimated the extent of FAK and Src phosphorylation in stably transfected ES2 cells upon incubation with RGDs. In agreement with the previous data, cells overexpressing CD82 displayed a significant reduction in the activation of the integrin signaling pathway in absence of RGDs as compared to N157Q mutant and control cells. Treatment with RGDs peptides dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of FAK and Src in control and N157Q mutant cells but, again, no further reduction was detectable in CD82 overexpressing cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D</bold>). RGDs treatment and N157 glycosylation leads also to a slower rate of cell migration besides inhibiting cell adhesion. Indeed, using transwell and high-content analysis we could demonstrate that the RGD-mediated inhibition of the integrin-fibronectin binding in control and N157Q mutant overexpressing cells reduced the transmigration capacity and cellular migration velocity to the levels of untreated CD82 overexpressing cells and did not exert any additional inhibitory influence in these latter cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>E-F</bold>,<bold> S3F</bold> and <bold>Videos 2A-F</bold>). Furthermore, the focal adhesion spots formation is a key step of cell adhesion or migration. We revealed that CD82 overexpressing cells significantly reduced the focal adhesion spots but not in N157Q mutant overexpressing cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>G</bold>). The treatment with RGDs reduced the focal adhesion spots formation in both CD82 and N157Q mutant overexpressing cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>G</bold>). All together these data strongly demonstrate that the glycosylation of CD82 at Asn157 inhibits cell motility and migration by disrupting the integrin-mediated anchorage to fibronectin leading thereby to a blunted activation of the signaling pathway downstream of integrin receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>CD82 glycosylation at Asn157 inhibits ovarian cancer metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>The results reported till now clearly demonstrate a pivotal role of CD82 glycosylation at N157 in the inhibition of ovarian cancer cell motility <italic>in vitro</italic>. We subcutaneously injected control, CD82 and N157Q mutant cells using a xenograft cancer model for 6 mice per group (N=6) in nude mice <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and analyzed the tumor growth (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A</bold>). According to the accepted role of CD82 as a metastasis suppressor, no impact on the growth rate of the primary tumors was discernible (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>B-C</bold>). In agreement with the postulated CD82 function, mice injected with CD82 cells displayed a reduced incidence of lung and liver metastasis. Notably, mice injected with control or N157Q mutant cells showed higher metastasis formation (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>D-E</bold>, <bold>S4A</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Table S4</xref></bold>).

Mice injected with CD82 cells exhibited significantly reduced the tumor cell dissemination as compared with control or N157Q cells by the total tumor weight per mouse (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>G, S4B</bold>). In addition, we demonstrate a clear reduction in the total size and volume of ascites per mouse injected with CD82 cells as compared with control or N157Q cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>H</bold>). Our findings provide compelling evidence for a pivotal role of the glycosylation at N157 in CD82-mediated inhibition of ovarian cancer invasion and metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>MGAT3 mediates glycosylation of CD82 in metastatic ovarian cancer</title><p>CD82 appears to be hypo-glycosylated in human metastatic ovarian tumors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D</bold>). Thereafter we uncovered the possible cause responsible for CD82 hypo-glycosylation. Wang and collaborators have demonstrated that CD82 glycosylation mainly consists of N-acetylglucosamine, (&#x003b1;-2, 6) N-acetylneuraminic acid, and a core fucose <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Noticeably, the modification is catalyzed by the enzyme MGAT3 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Interestingly, studies reported an association between reduced expression of MGAT3 and cancer metastasis <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>. A significant reduction of the mRNA and protein levels of MGAT3 was detected in metastatic tumors as well as in the ascites compared to primary tumors (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A-B</bold>, <bold>S4C</bold>). A lower MGAT3 expression was observed in lung metastasis compared with primary tumors using IHC (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C</bold>). In agreement with the results obtained in mice, a dramatic reduction of MGAT3 expression was detected in human metastatic ovarian tumors at the mRNA and protein levels (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D-F</bold>). A molecular complex formation between CD82 and MGAT3 would be required for CD82 glycosylation. Co-immunoprecipitation shows that endogenous MGAT3 efficiently co-precipitates with CD82 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>G</bold>, <bold>S4D-E</bold>). To unequivocally prove that MGAT3 is the enzyme responsible for CD82 glycosylation in ovarian cancer cells, we treated protein lysates from CD82 and N157Q mutant cells with recombinant PNGase F to remove the glycosylation moiety and subsequently subjected these lysates to treatment with recombinant MGAT3. In line with our expectation, treatment with recombinant MGAT3 after PNGase F addition increased the molecular weight of CD82 but not N157Q (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>H</bold>). These data strongly indicate that MGAT3 specifically promotes CD82 glycosylation at N157. To verify the function of MGAT3 mediated CD82 glycosylation, we performed the MGAT3 knockdown and overexpression assays. Knockdown MGAT3 in the ovarian cancer cell lines using shRNA impaired the glycosylation of CD82 (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>I</bold>). The overexpression of MGAT3 significantly reduced the transmigration capacity of control, CD82, and N198Q mutant but not of N157Q mutant cells (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>J</bold>). The efficient overexpression of MGAT3 was confirmed by western blotting (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>F</bold>). These data clearly demonstrate that MGAT3 is responsible for CD82 glycosylation and suggest that MGAT3 downregulation in metastatic ovarian cancer may promote metastasis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CD82 is a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein which has been implicated in a vast number of biological functions such as immune-response, differentiation, cancer growth and metastasis <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>.

Zhou et al. demonstrated that the palmitoylation of CD82 is required for its inhibitory role on migration and invasion of prostate cancer cell lines <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. The subcellular distribution of CD82 and its association with other tetraspanins are dependent on the palmitoylation.
