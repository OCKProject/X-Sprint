Metastasis is the major reason for the mortality of lung cancer patients. Cancer cell migration and invasion are initial steps in metastasis<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells is believed to be crucial for cancer cell invasion<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The process that epithelial cancer cells lose their polarity and displays mesenchymal phenotype is called EMT. Eph receptors, which comprise the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinase, have been found to play a role in EMT<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. The Eph receptors are divided into 2 subclasses: nine EphA receptors and five EphB receptors. Ephs and their ligands ephrins trigger bidirectional signal pathway upon cell-to-cell contact<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. Eph/ephrin interactions have been implicated in various pathologic processes, including inflammation, neural development, and angiogenesis<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Eph forward signaling that depends on Eph kinase activity has been involved in cell migration and evasion<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. However, bidirectional signals can also mediate cell repulsion<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>Eph receptors display dual role in tumor progression and tumor suppression<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. EphB subgroup and the Ephrin-B subgroup are coexpressed in SCLC cell lines and tumors, modulating the behavior of SCLC through autocrine or juxtacrine activation<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. EphA/B mutation or amplification can be found in 16% of lung adenocarcinoma patients<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. EphB3 promotes cancer cell survival and migration by enhancing DNA synthesis and inhibiting apoptosis in NSCLC cells<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Eph receptors that are activated by ephrins can inhibit oncogenic signaling pathways, such as the HRAS-Erk, PI3K-Akt and Abl-Crk pathways<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. The paradox may be because of the cis and trans signaling or ligand-dependent or ligand-independent Eph signaling.</p><p>In this study, we found that ligand-independent EphB1 promoted lung cancer cell mobility and invasion. TGF-&#x003b2;-activated Smad2 transcriptionally interacted with a Smad2-binding element in EphB1. Ligand-independent EphB1 promotes EMT through upregulating CDH2. However, the ligand induced EphB1 phosphorylation inhibited lung cancer mobility and invasion. A better understanding of context of EphB1 signaling can help to explain the paradox roles in cancer progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and Reagents</title><p>Antibodies to proteins were obtained from the following sources: EphB1 (#ab129103) and phos-EphB1 (#ab61791) for Western blot were purchased from Abcam; EphB1 (#AF542) for immunohistochemistry was purchased from Novus Biologicals; N-cadherin (#13116) and E-cadherin (#3195) were from Cell Signaling Technology; &#x003b2;-actin (#60008-1-Ig), Smad2 (#12570-1-AP) and GAPDH (#60004-1-Ig) were from Proteintech.

Proteins were quantified using the BCA<sup>TM</sup> Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, USA). A western blot system was set up using a Bio-Rad Bis-Tris Gel system, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The cell protein lysates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamidegels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Danvers, MA, USA). The primary antibody solution was prepared in 5% blocking buffer. Primary antibodies against EphB1 (Abcam, USA), p-EphB1 (Abcam, USA) were incubated with the membrane at 4 &#x000ba;C overnight, followed by a brief wash and incubation with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. An anti-GAPDH antibody control was purchased from Proteintech (Chicago, USA) and was used as a loading control. Finally, a 40:1 solution of peroxide and luminol was added to cover the blot surface for five minutes at room temperature. The chemiluminescent signals were captured, and the intensity of the bands was quantified using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad, CA,USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell migration and invasion assays</title><p>Cell migration and invasion assays were both performed using a transwell insert that contains polycarbonate filters with 8-&#x003bc;m pores (cat. no. 3422; Corning). Cells (5x10<sup>4</sup>) were suspended in 200 &#x000b5;l of serum-free medium and added to the transwell membrane in the upper chamber. Migrated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. Migrated cell images were observed and imaged under microscope (CKX41, Olympus, Japan). Cell migration was quantitated by counting in 10 random fields on the lower membrane surface. Invasion capacity of cells was measured by Matrigel matrix gel invasion assay. The surface of the filter (8-&#x003bc;m pore size) of the upper chamber was coated with 1 mg/ml Matrigel matrix. Cells (5x10<sup>4</sup>) were suspended in 200 &#x000b5;l of serum-free medium and added to the transwell membrane in the upper chamber.

Four- to six-&#x003bc;m thick paraffin sections were defaced followed by hydration. Tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody at 4&#x000b0;C overnight in a humidified chamber. After extensive washing with PBS, sections were incubated with biotin-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (UltraSensitive S-P Kit, Maixin Biotechnology Company, Fuzhou, China). The sections were then washed and followed by developing in 3'-diaminobenzidine hydrochloride (DAB) as chromogen, and sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. Finally, after dehydration and mounting, the sections were observed and imaged under microscope (OLYMPUS BX-51, Japan). Goat serum and PBS were used instead of the first antibody as a negative control and blank control respectively. A semi-quantitative scoring criterion for IHC was used in which both the staining intensity and positive areas were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA for RNA-seq experiment was used for real-time PCR to confirm the expression of genes. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).

Publicly accessible gene expression data of EphB1 was obtained from Gene Expression Ominibus (GEO) database (GSE10072, GSE19188, GSE7670, GSE68465, GSE30219, GSE50081) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. EphB1 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC samples compared to non-cancer controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Significant higher expression of EphB1 in cancer biopsies were found in patients with metastasis compared to non-metastatic patients with NSCLC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Gene expression data for NSCLC patients was used to analysis the correlation of EphB1 and overall survival (OS). Patients with higher levels of EphB1 expression showed shorter OS compared with the patients with lower levels of EphB1 (p&#x0003c;0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). EphB1 expression in lung biopsies was correlated with poor patient survival in lung cancer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). We verified EphB1 expression in patients by recruiting 60 NSCLC patients with or without metastasis. Clinicopathological characteristics of these patients are presented in Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Consistent with results obtained from public database, the higher EphB1 expression was detected in metastatic lung cancer samples than in non-metastatic lung cancer samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand-independent EphB1 signaling promotes cancer cell migration and invasion</title><p>To investigate the roles of EphB1 in the migration and mobility of lung cancer cell, we transfected EphB1 expression vector into H460 cells or EphB1 siRNA into A549 cells. The transwell assay revealed that EphB1 promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells and knockdown of EphB1 resulted in reduced migration and invasion in A549 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A, 2B and 2C). However, the ligand EphrinB2-Fc treatment on the contrary reduced migration and invasion of lung cancer cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). The overexpression of EphB1 did not affect the lung cancer cell growth (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>E, 2F).</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand-dependent EphB1 signaling inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion through inducing the phosphorylation of EphB1</title><p>As the phosphorylation of EphB1 mediated by its Tyr-594 is crucial to cell migration, we then examined the effect of EphB1 forced expression and ligand EphrinB2-Fc treatment on the phosphorylation of Tyr-594. We found that transfection of EphB1 inhibited EphB1 Tyr-594 phosphorylation, while treatment of EphrinB2-Fc promoted EphB1 Tyr-594 phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). It suggests the forced overexpression of EphB1 inhibits EphB1 forward signaling and exogenous EphrinB2-Fc promotes EphB1 forward signaling.</p><p>In order to investigate if the activation of EphB1 forward signaling affect the cell mobility, we transfected wild type EphB1 or EphB1 Y594 mutant into A549 cells. The exogeneous treatment of EphrinB2-Fc obviously inhibited the migration and invasion of EphB1 wt transfected cells, but significantly improved the migration and invasion of EphB1 Y594 mutant transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). It demonstrated that phosphorylation of EphB1 reduces migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, whereas the ligand-independent EphB1 promotes migration and invasion of lung cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand-independent EphB1 mediates TGF-&#x003b2;-activated CDH2</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of how EphB1 overexpression promotes the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, we compared the expression of EMT related molecules between cells with or without forced expression of EphB1.

We then examined if TGF-&#x003b2; regulates EphB1 expression. We found that TGF-&#x003b2; enhanced the expression of EphB1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C). Transfection of Smad2 enhanced the expression of EphB1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D, 4E).

Eph receptors and ephrins coexpressed in the same cells can attenuate receptor activation in trans by hindering the binding of ephrins and Eph receptors in trans<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. The coexpression of Ephrin-A3 can block the ability of EphA2 and EphA3 to link ephrins in <italic>trans</italic> and become activated, while Ephrin-B2 can deter not only EphB4 but also EphA3 in the cancer cells<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Eph receptors are often upregulated in many types of cancer, although decreased Eph receptor levels were also been observed in certain types of cancer<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. In contrast to the overexpression of Eph receptors in cancer, Eph receptor forward signaling that triggered by tyrosine phosphorylation inhibits tumor cell growth<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Higher expression of Ephrin-B2 is correlated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and bladder urothelial carcinoma<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>. The paradoxical functions of Eph are influenced by the cis- or trans- signaling. In this study, EphrinB2-Fc provided in trans mode can elicit EphB1 forward signaling, leading to reduced mobility and invasion. The overexpression of EphB1 without exogenous stimulation of Ephrin-B2, however, promotes mobility and invasion through upregulating EMT molecules.</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2; signaling is thought to drive EMT and trigger apoptosis.
