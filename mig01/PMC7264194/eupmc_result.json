    "The precise role of pre-mRNA processing factors (PRPs) in human tumorigenesis has not been yet explored. The object of the present study was to explore the effects of PRP3 in a common metastatic skin cancer, keratinocyte-derived cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCCs). RT-qPCR and western blotting were conducted to measure the expression levels of PRP3 in various cSCC cell lines and cSCC tissues. A benign epidermal keratinocyte cell line was transfected with a eukaryotic expression plasmid to overexpress PRP3. In addition, the endogenous expression level of PRP3 in cSCC cells was silenced using a short hairpin RNA method, and the role of PRP3 on cell proliferation and migration was examined by Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, wound healing assay and Transwell assays following knockdown in cSCC cells, and overexpression in keratinovcyte cells. Elevated levels of PRP3 mRNA and protein were noted in cSCC cell lines or cSCC tissues compared with actinic keratosis (AK) or benign epidermal keratinocyte cell line, respectively. Upregulation of PRP3 expression was found to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with cSCCs. The upregulation of PRP3 promoted cell viability, metastasis and the activity of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in epidermal keratinocyte cells. Interestingly, loss of PRP3 had no obvious impact on cell viability and migration in benign epidermal keratinocyte cells. Functionally, the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway reversed the increased cell viability and migration of cSCC cells induced by PRP3. Taken together, the present observations indicated that PRP3 served as a tumor active factor in cSCCs by targeting the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. Moreover, it is implied that impeding the PRP3 activity may selectively constrain cancer cell growth and migration with limited effect on normal skin cells."
