However, the role of circRNAs in cervical cancer (CC) remains unclear. CircRNA microarrays performed on the immortal cervical cell line H8 and the cervical cancer cell line SiHa were used to identify a circRNA, termed circNRIP1 (hsa_circ_0004771), which was upregulated in SiHa. QRT-PCR confirmed that circNRIP1 was upregulated in CC tissues, where its expression was correlated with lymphovascular space invasion. Besides, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that circNRIP1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, we found that miR-629-3p induced tumor suppression by regulating PTP4A1 and the ERK1/2 pathway. Finally, we confirmed that circNRIP1 exerts its effect, at least partially, by sponging miR-629-3p and thereby regulating the PTP4A1/ERK1/2 pathway. Therefore, circNRIP1 may be useful as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in CC patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cervical cancer</kwd><kwd>Cell invasion</kwd><kwd>Non-coding RNAs</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Free Researcher Project of Shengjing Hospital (Grant No.201302).</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100005047</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province (Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20170541003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Zhuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">According to the National Central Cancer Registry of China (NCCRC), cervical cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women in China, with ~111,000 newly diagnosed cases and nearly 34,000 new deaths in 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, between 2009 and 2015, 36% and 15% of women, respectively, were diagnosed at regional and distant stages of cancer progression, despite the availability of viable prevention strategies and vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

Results showed that miR-149-5p was upregulated in sh-cNRIP1 group while miR-653 was also upregulated rather than downregulated in the OV-cNRIP1 group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>). Meanwhile, circNRIP1 also increased ZEB2 expression and decreased E-cadherin expression in CC cells, indicating that circNRIP1 was also involved in EMT in cervical cancer (Figs. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6h</xref>, S<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>I&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">J</xref>). Considered together, these findings support the hypothesis that circNRIP1 promotes cervical cancer cell migration and invasion, at least partially, by sponging miR-629-3p and regulating the PTP4A1/ERK1/2 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>CircNRIP1 promotes the growth of cervical cancer tumors in vivo</title><p id="Par33">To further investigate whether circNRIP1 regulated tumor growth in vivo, HeLa cells transfected with OV-cNRIP1 or OV-NC were injected subcutaneously into BALB/c nude female mice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). Tumor volumes were monitored 7&#x02009;d following injection. The mice were humanely euthanized 3 weeks following injection, subcutaneous tumor tissues isolated, and the volume and weight of dissected tumors measured. Overexpression of circNRIP1 significantly promoted tumor growth in vivo (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b&#x02013;d</xref>). Furthermore, qRT-PCR (3 samples per group) showed that circNRIP1 was upregulated and miR-629-3p was downregulated in the OV-cNRIP1 group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e, f</xref>). IHC (3 samples per group) confirmed that PTP4A1 was elevated in the tumor tissues of the OV-cNRIP1 group, compared with those of the control group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>).

Furthermore, circRNAs may be of use as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancers due to their special stable loop structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the expression profile and function of circRNAs in cervical cancer remains unclear. The current study performed a microarray analysis on SiHa and H8 cell lines and identified a novel circRNA, termed circNRIP1, which was significantly upregulated in the SiHa cell. Next, we validated the differential expression between H8 and SiHa using qRT-PCR. We further quantified the expression of circNRIP1 in tumor tissues obtained from cervical cancer patients. The results revealed that circNRIP1 was upregulated in tumor tissues and that its expression was significantly correlated with LVSI. LVSI is an important intermediate risk factor used to guide adjuvant treatment decisions and fertility-sparing approaches, which is difficult to assess before surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Thus, circNRIP1 may be a good indicator of LVSI, and thereby guide CC treatment. However, the sample size used in our study was small and did not include samples from patients in advanced stages of cancer who had lost the opportunity to qualify for surgical resection of the lesions due to metastasis. Besides, circNRIP1 expression was detected only in tumor tissues, and not in serum, which may be more suitable for biomarker detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Additionally, cervical cytology has long been used to test for cervical neoplasia. Many studies have used exfoliated cervical cells to detect cancer-specific gene methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, liquid-based cytology samples may be more suitable for detection of circRNAs due to the non-invasiveness associated with this technique. In summary, further clinical studies using larger sample sizes and a wider variety of samples, including tumor tissues, serum, and cervical liquid-based cytology are needed to evaluate the clinical value of circNRIP1 as a biomarker.</p><p id="Par35">Next, gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrated that circNRIP1 may promote cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. Growing evidence has shown that circRNAs may function in the sponging of miRNAs in cervical cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. A dual-luciferase assay and qRT-PCRs, performed by the current study, confirmed that circNRIP1 may sponge miR-629-3p. MiR-629-3p has been reported to promote lung carcinoma and breast cancer progression, but has not been reported on in the context of cervical cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in our study, gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vitro showed that miR-629-3p inhibited cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. MiR-629-3p expression was downregulated in tumor tissues, and higher levels of miR-629-3p were correlated with better prognoses in CESC. Moreover, we found a new target gene of miR-629-3p termed <italic>PTP4A1</italic>. PTP4A1 reportedly promotes ERK1/2 activation and thereby the expression of MMP2 and -9, which, in turn, induces cell migration and invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that miR-629-3p acts as a tumor suppressor in CC by targeting <italic>PTP4A1</italic> and regulating the ERK1/2 pathway. Our analysis of the expression levels of these proteins in different cell groups confirmed this hypothesis.</p><p id="Par36">Based on the above results, we hypothesized that circNRIP1 functions by regulating the miR-629-3p/PTP4A1/ERK1/2 axis. Further rescue experiments showed that miR-629-3p rescued the phenotypes of cells overexpressing circNRIP1, and that inh-629-3p restored the effects of circNRIP1 knockdown on cell function. Moreover, circNRIP1 also enhanced the oncogenic effect of PTP4A1 and consequently activated ERK1/2. Considered together, our findings indicated that circNRIP1 functions by sponging miR-629-3p and regulating its target <italic>PTP4A1</italic> to promote cell migration and invasion. Besides, circRNAs reportedly regulate cell growth by sponging multiple miRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Our results also indicated that miR-149-3p may also function in SiHa cells but not in HeLa cells. Therefore, our results could only conclude that circNRIP1 functions, at least partially, by sponging miR-629-3p in cervical cancer. Thus, we inferred that circNRIP1 may act as an oncogene in multiple cancers, functioning by sponging different miRNAs or even sponging multiple miRNAs simultaneously due to the specific cells or tissues involved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Many studies have reported that ceRNA-mediated regulation may be determined by the number of transcriptomic miRNA-binding sites and miRNA abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, we propose that these results may due to the differences in the abundance of circNRIP1, miRNAs, and miRNA targets in different cell lines. However, the mechanism via which circNRIP1 changes its mode of function in different cancers requires further exploration.</p><p id="Par37">In conclusion, our results indicated that circNRIP1 is significantly upregulated in CC tissues and promotes migration and invasion in CC, at least partially, by sponging miR-629-3p and regulating the PTP4A1/ERK1/2 pathway. Our results provide additional evidence indicating that circRNAs function as miRNA sponges, suggesting that circNRIP1 may be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
