However, little is known about lipid alternations in CAFs and how these metabolic reprogramming affect CRC cells metastasis. Here, we uncover CAFs conditioned medium (CM) promote the migration of CRC cells compared with normal fibroblasts CM. CAFs undergo a lipidomic reprogramming, and accumulate more fatty acids and phospholipids. CAFs CM after protein deprivation still increase the CRC cells migration, which suggests small molecular metabolites in CAFs CM are responsible for CRC cells migration. Then, we confirm that CRC cells take up the lipids metabolites that are secreted from CAFs. Fatty acids synthase (FASN), a crucial enzyme in fatty acids synthesis, is significantly increased in CAFs. CAF-induced CRC cell migration is abolished by knockdown of FASN by siRNA or reducing the uptake of fatty acids by CRC cells by sulfo-N-succinimidyloleate sodium in vitro and CD36 monoclonal antibody in vivo. To conclude, our results provide a new insight into the mechanism of CRC metastasis and suggest FASN of CAFs or CD36 of CRC cells may be potential targets for anti-metastasis treatment in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Cancer metabolism</kwd><kwd>Cancer microenvironment</kwd><kwd>Cancer microenvironment</kwd><kwd>Cancer metabolism</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National keypoint research and invention program of china Ministry of Science and Technologyh(MOST-2016YFC1303200) National S&#x00026;T Major project(2018ZX09201018)</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most commonly diagnosed malignant cancer, ranks third in cancer mortality worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Metastasis is the major cause for the death of terminal stage patients of CRC. The majority of patients with metastatic CRC only have a median survival of 2 years that is far from satisfaction. Recent studies illustrate that tumor metastasis is closely depended on the interaction of tumor cells with tumor microenvironment (TME), which is a dynamic, changing network.</p><p id="Par3">There are many non-tumor stromal cells in the TME and the functional changes of these stromal cells affect the malignant potential of tumor cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the main components of stromal cells surrounding cancer cells. CAFs are active fibroblasts that proliferate faster, and secrete more cytokines, matrix proteins, and immunomodulatory factors compared with normal fibroblasts (NFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. It is now established that CAFs play an indispensable role in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis mainly by remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), induction of angiogenesis, secretion growth factors and cytokines, and promoting epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. For instance, CAFs promote cancer cells invasion by making passageways through collagen I/Matrigel gels. CAFs also lead tumor growth and metastasis via cytokine and microRNA interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, recent works reveal the impact of metabolic interaction between CAFs and tumor cells on tumor metastasis.</p><p id="Par4">Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of tumor cells. Cancer cells frequently have a dominating glycolysis metabolism, the &#x0201c;Warburg effect&#x0201d;, to generate the building block for synthesis and a large amount of ATP for their fast proliferation in nutrient shorted microenvironment. The metabolic adaptation of cancer cells not only permits the development and establishment of a tumor in a certain microenvironment, but also conditions the response to the therapy. Metabolic adaptation cannot be assessed exclusively from the cancer cell point of view, but should also consider the contribution of normal (noncancerous) cells in the same tissue or organ. In cancer, the surrounding cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and adipocytes) influence the TME, the tumor cell biology, and metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The emerging view becomes focusing on metabolic alternation of CAFs. In order to adapt to the deficiency of nutrients and oxygen in TEM, and the increased requirements of energy and building blocks crucial for maintaining high proliferation, CAFs undergo metabolic reprogramming. Current studies on CAFs metabolic reprogramming mainly focus on glycol metabolism and amino acid metabolism reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Some studies show that compared with NFs, CAFs have an enhanced aerobic glycolysis and decreased oxidative phosphorylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. As a consequence of glycolysis, CAFs could produce large amounts of lactate. The excess lactate is then released to the ECM and results in acidic microenvironment that is thought to favor the metastatic potential of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Studies on the role of amino acid metabolism in CAFs have demonstrated that CAFs produce a variety of metabolic substrates for cancer cells, including glutamine. Glutamine increases the autophagy of fibroblasts that may be the fundamental energy to promote the activity of mitochondria in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Glutamate ammonia ligase, the key enzyme in glutamine synthesis, is upregulated in CAFs. The glutamine importers (e.g., SLC6 A14) of cancer cells are upregulated in a glutamine concentration-dependent pattern in the presence of fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Besides well-known glycolysis and glutamine metabolism, there is increasing evidence that lipids play critical roles in tumorigenesis and progression.</p><p id="Par5">Changes in lipid metabolism affect many cancer cells process, including cell growth, proliferation, motility, autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that lipids can directly regulate non-tumor stromal cells in the TME. For example, activated CD8+ T cells reprogram the cholesterol metabolism and synthesize more free cholesterol to support rapid cell proliferation. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) derived CAFs secrete abundant lyso-phosphatidylcholines (LPCs) in the activated, fibroblastic state. Lipid released by PSCs promotes multiple hallmarks of aggressive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression, including PDAC cell proliferation and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. BM adipocytes support acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) cell survival by regulating their metabolic energy balance, and that the disruption of FAO in BM adipocytes may be an alternative, novel therapeutic strategy for AMoL therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, lipid modification in CAFs may have impact on tumor progression. However, little is known about lipid alternation in CAFs and how these metabolic reprogramming affect CRC cells metastasis.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we comprehensively analyze the lipidomic modification of CAFs by using an Acquity UPLC-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Our studies reveal CAFs from CRC tissues undergo a lipidomic reprogramming, and enhance the CRC cells migration by these lipid metabolites crosstalk, which are from CAFs activated fatty acid de novo synthesis and reduced catabolism. Taken together, our study provides a new insight to explain how CAFs stimulate tumor metastasis and present a potential target for tumor metastasis therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of primary NFs and CAFs</title><p id="Par7">The abundances of fibroblasts in TME were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of &#x003b1;-SMA, and the results showed that high density of &#x003b1;-SMA expression were observed in CRC tissues than that in normal adjacent tissues (NATs), which suggest that fibroblasts is more abundance in CRC tissues (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The primary NFs and CAFs were isolated from fresh CRC tissues and NATs, and they showed a spindle shape (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Moreover, &#x003b1;-SMA were overexpressed in CAFs compared with in NFs, which indicating that CAFs were more active than NFs. The expression of fibroblast biomarkers was further confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot. The results showed that both mRNA and protein expression levels of &#x003b1;-SMA in CAFs were significantly higher than that of NFs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d, e</xref>).

The result showed that both CAFs conditioned medium (CM) and NFs CM promoted the proliferation of CRC compared with CRC CM. However, there was no significant difference between CAFs CM and NFs CM (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1a</xref>). Then, we explored the effects of CAFs on CRC cells migration. We firstly screened the metastatic potential of CRC cells by detecting the ratio of E-cadherin relative to Vimentin, since E-cadherin and Vimentin are important EMT marker. The results showed DLD1 cells had higher value of E-cadherin/Vimentin, which indicated DLD1 cells had the least metastasis inclination (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1b</xref>). Thus, we chose DLD1 to detect the impact of CAFs on cell migration. The transwell assay and wound-healing assay showed CAFs CM significantly enhanced the migration of DLD1 cells compared with NFs CM and DLD1 CM (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2a&#x02013;c</xref>). Immunofluorescence results showed that the expression Vimentin increased, while the expression of E-cadherin decreased in DLD1 after CAFs CM treatment (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2d</xref>). We then examined the mRNA expression of metastasis-related gene in DLD1 cells after CAFs CM treatment. The result indicated that CAFs CM increased the mRNA expression of Vimentin, MMP2, MMP9, Snail, whereas NFs CM not (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2e</xref>). Meanwhile, western blot analysis showed CAFs CM enhanced Vimentin protein expression and reduced E-cadherin expression in DLD1, whereas NFs CM not (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2f</xref>). Taken together, these data illustrated that CAFs promoted the DLD1 migration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>CAFs undergo a lipidomic reprogramming</title><p id="Par9">Previous studies have reported enhanced glycolysis in CAFs of CRC. However, there is little research refer to the lipidomic profile of CAFs. To explore the alternation of lipid metabolism of CAFs and whether it promotes migration of CRC cells, we detected lipid profiling of CAFs and NFs and their CM by using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS based on lipidomic assay. The lipidomic profile of CAFs CM are significant different from NFs CM. The heat map displayed that most of phospholipids, fatty acyls, and cholesteryl ester (CE) was increased in CAFs CM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). And we presented the relative level of all lipid derivatives in CAFs and NFs (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Lipids class statistic showed among 92 changed lipids, the fatty acyls accounted for the most proportion of those modified lipids, which is 44% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Deeply analysis of fatty acyls profile showed most of altered fatty acyls are lipids with long, polyunsaturated carbon chain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e&#x02013;h</xref>). Further analysis of lipid metabolites revealed that fatty acids, diglycerides (DGs), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), LPC, and phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) significantly increased (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Meanwhile, the lipidomic profile of CAFs and NFs showed that fatty acyls in CAFs was still higher than NFs. However, lipid in cells was significantly lower than that in CM (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">3b</xref>). Taken together, these data indicated that CAFs underwent a lipidomic reprogramming, and excreted more fatty acyls and phospholipids than NFs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>CAFs undergo a lipid reprogramming.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Heat map of the modified lipids between CAFs CM and NFs CM.

Thus, we hypothesized that the CAFs may enhance CRC cells migration by supporting lipids metabolites. In order to demonstrate our speculation, we deprived the large molecules protein in CM by using three freeze-thaw cycles to damage the protein followed by filtration with 3-kD cutoff filter. We observed that CAFs CM after large molecules protein deprivation still had the ability to increase the DLD1 migration in both wound-healing assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, c</xref>) and transwell migration assay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>), whereas NFs CM not. Immunofluorescence results showed that the expression Vimentin increased, while the expression of E-cadherin decreased in DLD1 after protein-filtered CAFs CM treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Moreover, CAFs CM after large molecules protein deprivation enhanced Vimentin expression and reduced E-cadherin expression in both mRNA and protein level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>). These results indicated that the factors inducing DLD1 migration were small size and lacked tertiary structure, suggesting that the factors could be metabolites. Therefore, CAFs CM after large molecules protein deprivation was used in following experiments.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Metabolites in CAF CM enhance DLD1 migration ability.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Migration of DLD1 cells were analyzed by Wound-Healing assay <bold>a</bold> (scale bars, 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;m) and transwell assay <bold>b</bold> (scale bars, 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;m), respectively, after protein-filtered CM treatment.

Specifically, we sought molecules that were overrepresented in CAFs CM (and therefore secreted by CAFs); underrepresented in the CAFs CM after contact with DLD1 cells (removed by DLD1 cells); and overrepresented in DLD1 cells co-cultured with the CAFs CM (taken up by DLD1 cells). Of ~200 metabolites analyzed, we found 19 lipids followed this pattern, including five fatty acyls, five glycerolipids (GL), eight glycerophospholipids (GP), and one CE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). We next analyzed the lipids metabolites in DLD1 cells co-cultured with CAFs CM comparing with DLD1 cells co-cultured with DLD1 CM. The results showed lipids, including PC, PE, phosphatidylserine, PI, phosphatidic acid (PA), DG, and triglyceride (TG) are increased significantly after CAFs CM treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>).

Although the development of CRC has been widely studied, the exact mechanism of CRC metastasis has not been fully clarified. Metabolic interaction between CAFs and CRC cells plays a major role in CRC progression. In this study, we find that lipid metabolism reprogramming occurs in CAFs, mainly in the increase of fatty acids, phospholipids, and glycerides. The fatty acids and phospholipids that are secreted by CAFs are uptake by CRC cells, and then promote CRC cells migration. By knockdown FASN in CAFs or inhibiting CRC cells uptake of fatty acids by SSO in vitro or CD36 monoclonal antibody in vivo, migration promotion effect of CAFs on CRC cells is partially reversed. These findings reveal a novel lipidomic interaction between CAFs and CRC cells, and link this lipids crosstalk with CRC metastasis. This finding highlights a previously unappreciated lipidomic network within CRC, provides a new insight into the mechanism of CRC metastasis.</p><p id="Par18">In recent years, more and more studies have shown that CAFs communicate with tumor cells via secreting growth factors and producing ECM-degrading proteases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, other studies have shown that metabolic reprogramming of CAFs are important in tumor progress. For example, enhanced glycolysis in CAFs has been discovered in various kinds of cancers, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, as well as CRC (refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>). Moreover, CAFs can secrete metabolites to fuel the proliferation of tumor cells. Lactate, the product of Warburg effect secreted by CAFs could be absorbed by prostate cancer cells and promote their growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. PSCs (fibroblasts in pancreatic tumor) support pancreatic cancer metabolism by secreting alanine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Although numerous efforts have been put on metabolic interaction between CAFs and tumor cells, most of them are considered glucose and glutamine metabolism, few considered lipid metabolism. In this study, we compare the lipidomic profile of CM from three paired NFs and CAFs from patients with CRC. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to analyze the lipidomic profile of fibroblasts in CRC. Our results show that the greatest number of lipid changes in the exocrine secretion of CAFs are fatty acyl, and that the number of long-chain and unsaturated fatty acids change most, and the content of phospholipid pathway-related metabolites in CAFs is higher than that in NFs. We speculate that the exocrine lipids of CAFs may affect the metastasis of CRC cells in a direct or indirect way. On the one hand, these elevated lipids may directly promote the growth and metastasis of tumors. We observed an increase in prostaglandins, such as PGE2 (FA 23:3) and it has been reported that PEG2 can promote the formation of CRC (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>). Exogenous lipid intake can support the rapid proliferation of tumors as an essential ability of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Fatty acid uptake-related genes, such as caveolin-1 and CD36, are abundantly present in metastatic tumors and have been associated with EMT in multiple cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. On the other hand, the elevation of these exogenous lipids may indirectly increase malignant transformation of tumors by creating an immunosuppressive environment. We find that unsaturated fatty acyl substances increase significantly, which may be related to the creation of an immunosuppressive environment. Unsaturated fatty acids have been reported to inhibit the antitumor activity of T cells through CD36/PPAR pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">We next confirm that small molecule metabolites in CM of CAFs can promote the migration of CRC cells. We find that CRC cells uptake the metabolites secreted by CAFs, including fatty acids, phospholipids, DGs, and cholesterol esters, through co-culture metabolism experiments. They alter tumor metabolism and promote the activation of downstream pathways, such as phospholipids, sphingolipids, and glycerides. Lipid metabolism reprogramming of tumors can affect their own characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Rapid proliferative tumors need to synthesize large amount of lipids to support the synthesis of organelle biofilms, and also is required to compensate for the lack of energy caused by glucose deficiency through lipid decomposition. In addition, lipids can also promote tumor migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate and fatty acids can promote tumor metastasis ability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In the present study, we find that long-chain and unsaturated lipids change most in CRC cells after co-culturing with CAFs CM. Junjie Li et al. reported that lipid desaturation could promote CSC phenotypes in breast cancer cells, and CSCs are closely related to tumor recurrence and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The expression of fatty acid translocase CD36 elevates intracellular fatty acid levels and promotes EMT of hepatocellular carcinoma cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. These results can provide some support for CAFs to promote tumor development through lipid metabolites.</p><p id="Par20">Thereafter, we interfere with the expression of CAFs FASN by siRNA or reduce the uptake of fatty acids by CRC cells by SSO in vitro or CD36 monoclonal antibody in vivo, and the migration ability of CRC cells are significantly downregulated. There are studies have demonstrated the important role of fatty acid uptake and CD36 in cancer progress. For example, CD36 deletion restricts fatty acid uptake from the TME, reduces cancer-mediated lipid biosynthesis from fatty acid precursors and the generation of oncogenic lipid signaling pathways, and attenuates cancer growth, exogenous fatty acids are of equal importance as glucose for energy provision and contribute to the production of complex lipids in human prostate cancer. And we also found the protein expression levels of &#x003b1;-SMA in siNC CAFs and siFASN CAFs, showed that FASN knockdown reduced the level of &#x003b1;-SMA in CAFs. These results suggested that a high-fatty acid metabolism and interaction prompted metastasis and FASN of CAFs or CD36 of tumor cells may be two potential targets for anti-metastasis in the future and FASN was a crucial enzyme in CAFs. Previously, FASN, a key regulator of the de novo synthesis of fatty acids, has been widely studied as a target of anticancer metabolic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Overexpression of FASN is associated with poor prognosis and increased multidrug resistance. Efthymia et al. reported FASN inhibition using orlistat is an effective adjunctive treatment for ovarian cancers that have become platinum resistant using a cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor xenograft model in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Gong et al. reported inhibition of FASN can suppress migration, invasion, and healing of hepatoma carcinoma cells by decreasing HIF-1&#x003b1; and IGFBP1 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>). However, our results suggest that it may not be enough to inhibit the lipid synthesis of tumor cells. The upregulation of FASN in CAFs provides the central precursor of lipid synthesis-fatty acid for cancer cells to promote the synthesis of downstream lipids, such as phospholipids and sphingolipids. Therefore, in the future, the intervention of lipid metabolism in tumor cells may not only focus on the tumor cells, but also consider the fibroblasts.</p><p id="Par21">Taken together, our results demonstrate novel lipidomic interaction between CAFs and CRCs, and link this lipids crosstalk with CRC metastasis.
