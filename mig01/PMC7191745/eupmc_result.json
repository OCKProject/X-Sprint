    "BACKGROUND:The involvement of lncRNA FEZF1-AS1 has been analyzed in many types of cancers, while its roles in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. We then explored the role of FEZF1-AS1 in NSCLC. METHODS:qPCR and western blot were performed to measure gene expression. FEZF1-AS1, miR-34a, and NOTCH-1 were overexpressed to analyze the relationship between them. Transwell assays were performed to analyze the effects of transfections on cell invasion and migration. RESULTS:FEZF1-AS1 was up-regulated in NSCLC patients. Increased expression levels of FEZF1-AS1 were observed with the increase in clinical stages. Bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-34a can bind with FEZF1-AS1. In NSCLC tissues, NOTCH-1 and FEZF1-AS1 were positively correlated. In NSCLC cells, over-expression of FEZF1-AS1 resulted in up-regulated expressions of NOTCH-1, while miR-34a over-expression mediated down-regulated expressions of NOTCH-1. In addition, FEZF1-AS1 and miR-34a did not alter each other, while bioinformatics analysis showed that miR-34a can bind FEZF1-AS1. Analysis of cell migration and invasion showed increased cell invasion and migration rates after FEZF1-AS1 and NOTCH-1 over-expression. MiR-34a played the opposite role and reduced the effects of FEZF1-AS1 over-expression. CONCLUSIONS:FEZF1-AS1 promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion through the up-regulation of NOTCH1 by serving as a sponge of miR-34a."
