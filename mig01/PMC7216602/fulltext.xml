However, this procedure is considered the most difficult and invasive endoscopic procedure with an associated complication rate of approximately 15% and mortality rate of 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) was first performed in 1979 and has since become a well-established palliative treatment for either benign or malignant biliary obstruction. The complications associated with endoscopic biliary stenting include stent migration, cholangitis, stent blockage, haemorrhage, perforation, and pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Among these, stent migration is the most common complication. Distal or proximal displacement of a biliary stent occurs in 5&#x02013;10% of patients with biliary stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, gastrointestinal penetration or transmural perforation due to stent migration is rare, with an incidence of less than 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

The Stapfer classification is the most widely used. However, none of the abovementioned classifications cover all types of ERCP-related perforations. For instance, intestinal wall perforations caused by bile duct stent migration, as mentioned in this paper, and perforation of the jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and sigmoid colon due to bile duct stent migration, as mentioned in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], cannot be included in the above classifications.</p><p id="Par29">Endoscopically placed plastic biliary stents were first used for bile duct drainage in 1979. Subsequently, ERBD has become a widely accepted and well-established therapy for either benign or malignant biliary obstruction. The literature indicates that the complication rate for biliary stents can range from 8 to 10%, and the most common complication is proximal or distal stent migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Duodenal perforation secondary to distal stent migration has been well documented in the literature. However, owing to the low incidence of this serious and life-threatening complication (less than 1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], preventive and therapeutic methods continue to be a matter of debate.</p><p id="Par30">Stent-related duodenal perforations are mainly caused by distal biliary stent migration. Thus, it is very important to determine the risk factors of biliary stent migration. However, according to a few studies, thus far, the risk factors of stent migration have not been identified definitively. Kawaguchi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] demonstrated that the risk factors for biliary stent migration include straight-type stents, common bile duct diameter&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02009;mm, stent duration &#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x02009;month, and stent with large diameter (frequency of migration was significantly higher in cases with 10-Fr stents compared with that in cases with 7-Fr stents). Moreover, undergoing endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) before stent placement and long biliary stent are considered risk factors for distal stent migration rather than proximal stent migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition to these risk factors, Arhan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported that biliary stent migration is more likely to occur in cases of benign biliary stenosis than in cases of malignant biliary stenosis. One reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that local inflammation around the stent due to benign biliary strictures could be alleviated after biliary drainage. However, the growth of malignant tissues helps anchor the biliary stent tightly in cases of malignant strictures. In our cases, this type of perforation occurred between 3 and 75&#x02009;days after ERBD, which demonstrated that stent-related duodenal perforation can occur regardless of stent duration. Among the three cases at our institution, two cases of distal stent migration were noted in patients with stent duration &#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x02009;month. Moreover, according to our cases (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and the cases reported in the literature (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), all migrated biliary stents are of the straight type, which are more prone to distal migration compared to pig-tailed biliary stents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Double-pigtail biliary stents may exert an anti-migration effect by anchoring in the bile duct, and their pliable and soft plastic may prevent intestinal perforation due to stent migration. Especially, when treating patients with high risk factors for biliary stent migration, such as long stent duration, EST, common bile duct diameter&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10&#x02009;mm, the use of pigtail stents is strongly recommended. Accordingly, periodic follow-ups and timely stent replacement are highly likely to prevent such perforations effectively. Moreover, the selection of suitable stents (pig-tailed, appropriate length, diameter etc.) and avoidance of unnecessary EST may have some preventive effect on such perforations.

If a perforation is highly suspected, an abdominal CT should be the preferred imaging examination. The diagnosis of a stent-related duodenal perforation can be confirmed by CT findings of intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal free air, effusion, or duodenal wall penetration caused by the distal stent. Immediate recognition of perforations is very important for the selection of surgical intervention and achieving more favourable patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par32">Presently, no relevant guidelines exist for preventing and managing duodenal perforations secondary to stent migration. Herein, we reviewed the extant literature and found that 20 cases involving stent-related duodenal perforation have been reported thus far (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Of these 20 cases, 8 cases were treated with surgery and 12 with endoscopic management. Different surgical methods, such as simple repair, duodenectomy, choledochojejunostomy, and gastric bypass, were selected depending on the specific conditions during the surgery. In the 12 cases of endoscopic management of duodenal perforation reported in the literature, all distally migrated stents were extracted directly by using foreign body forceps or snares. In 10 of these 12 cases, the perforated duodenal wall was successfully sealed with endoscopic clips or fibrin glue under observation with an endoscope. As shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, surgical management was previously recognized as the main treatment modality for stent-related duodenal perforation. However, endoscopic stent removal and closure is currently justified for the management of such perforations, mainly because of the development of endoscopic techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Undeniably, the treatment strategies for such perforations are increasingly tending toward minimally invasive and conservative procedures. Of the three cases in our hospital, in the first case, owing to our lack of experience, the only endoscopic treatment performed was removal of the displaced stent. In the other two cases, we inserted nasobiliary drainage after endoscopic removal of the displaced stents and closure of the duodenal perforations. In all the three cases, the patients recovered completely owing to effective endoscopic management. The length of hospitalization of the third patient was significantly shorter than those of the first two. Therefore, we believe that closure of the defect and bile drainage using ENBD tubes can reduce bile stimulation of the defects on the duodenal wall, which is conducive to create a good environment for the healing of perforated sites and hastening patient rehabilitation.</p><p id="Par33">According to previous literature (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), there were four deaths. Of these cases, two patients underwent surgical intervention and two received endoscopic management. The two patients who underwent surgical intervention died from postoperative infection. Of the two patients who underwent endoscopic management, one died from advanced gallbladder cancer 3&#x02009;months after successful endoscopic management of the perforation, and the other patient died from intraoperative mediastinal emphysema, an extremely rare complication owing to air leakage from the defect in the intestinal wall. The use of minimal CO2 insufflation instead of air insufflation and reduction of procedure time could possibly have prevented this fatal complication. Moreover, unexplained dyspnoea, chest pain, and oxygen desaturation accompanied with abdominal distension during endoscopic repair of perforations must alert clinicians to this life-threatening complication. A diagnosis of pneumothorax can be further confirmed using fluoroscopy, chest CT scan, or X-ray combined with diminished breath sounds. According to a review of the reported literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], most patients with ERCP-related pneumothorax can be treated conservatively by means of nasogastric tube placement, chest drainage, and broad spectrum antibiotics. Early diagnosis and prompt management are important for optimising patient outcomes.</p><p id="Par34">In our opinion, endoscopic management of duodenal perforations due to biliary stent migration has the following advantages: (i) The diameter of defect is small in most cases; thus, an endoscopic clip can effectively close the defect after removal of the stent under observation with an endoscope. (ii) Bile drainage plays an important role in the healing of duodenal defects secondary to biliary stent migration. ENBD is an effective technique for biliary drainage that can help prevent both bile-induced irritation of the defect and recurrence of biliary obstruction secondary to the primary disease after stent removal. (iii) Endoscopic treatment can reduce the degree of invasiveness and ensure faster recovery than laparotomy; however, it has higher requirements in terms of the endoscopist&#x02019;s skill and experience. All three cases in our department were cured with endoscopic management, demonstrating that endoscopic treatment can often achieve ideal results for such perforations.</p><p id="Par35">In conclusion, duodenal perforation caused by the migration of biliary stents is a rare complication. Abdominal CT scanning is the preferred imaging examination, and subsequent endoscopic treatment is feasible and effective.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ERBD</term><def><p id="Par4">Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par5">Computerized tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERCP</term><def><p id="Par6">Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBDS</term><def><p id="Par7">Common bile duct stone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AOSC</term><def><p id="Par8">Acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p id="Par9">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PS</term><def><p id="Par10">Plastic stent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Fr</term><def><p id="Par11">French</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBD</term><def><p id="Par12">Common bile duct</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GB</term><def><p id="Par13">Gallbladder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCCA</term><def><p id="Par14">Hilar cholangiocarcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SEMS</term><def><p id="Par15">Self-expandable metal stents</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WBC</term><def><p id="Par16">White blood cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>N%</term><def><p id="Par17">Percentage of neutrophils</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p id="Par18">Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p id="Par19">Aspartate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>Xiaopeng Wang and Junwen Qu contributed equally to this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the understanding and cooperation of the patients.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>XPW and JWQ carried out data acquisition and drafted the manuscript.
