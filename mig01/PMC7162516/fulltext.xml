It is assumed that the successful outcome of AT transfer essentially depends on the amount of autocrine-generated growth factors (GF). It is supposed that several GF enhance and improve the anatomic and functional integration of the transplanted AT grafts at the site of implantation. In the present study we have investigated for the first time the correlation between the concentration of GF of freshly isolated AT and the proliferation and migration capacity of mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) derived from the respective AT sample. We here show that the proliferation and migration capacity of MSCs strongly depends on the GF content of the AT the cells were isolated from but in an inversely proportional manner. The lower the GF content of an AT sample was, the higher was the proliferation and migration capacity of the respective MSC population contained in the AT and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Furthermore, we found that supplementation with recombinant GFs only in the case of AT samples with low but not with higher growth factor contents led to a significant enhancement of proliferation and migration of the AT-resident MSCs. As we further show, this inefficiency of GFs to enhance MSC proliferation and migration in AT samples with high GF contents indicates a GF-mediated negative feedback mechanism leading to an impaired GF signaling in MSC obtained from those AT samples. Our results might explain why the successful use of AT grafting is frequently limited by low and unpredictable survival rates, and we suggest to use the knowledge of GF content of harvested AT as a predictive clinical parameter for risk assessment of the therapeutic outcome of autologous AT transfer.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Faculty of Medicine of the RWTH Aachen University and the Faculty of Medicine of the Heinrich-Heine-University D&#x000fc;sseldorf.

By their ability to migrate to the site of a tissue damage MSCs have an extraordinary therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine. Various therapeutic approaches are based on the systematic administration of previously isolated MSCs. The success of this application form of MSCs depends essentially on the fact that the greatest possible number of these cells migrate successfully into the desired tissue area after their administration. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of the cells reach the target tissue after systematic administration. Therefore, current efforts concerning the improvement of the therapeutic efficiency of MSC-based therapies, spatially address the molecular mechanisms underlying MSC homing, i.e. initial tethering of MSCs by selectins, activation by cytokines, arrest by integrins, diapedesis or transmigration, their extravascular migration toward chemokine gradients (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]).</p><p>In modern reconstructive surgery, attempts are also made to use the positive effects of MSCs, with isolated MSCs being used directly locally or even being transplanted into the lesion area in their natural tissue environment. The transplantation of adipose tissue has proven particularly useful here. Adipose tissue is an ideal material for use as a permanent soft tissue replacement [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It has found wide acceptance and is used for a variety of indications [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is readily obtainable, easy to sculpture, and as it is autologous, the risk of antigenic and allergic reactions is minimized. Thus, autologous adipose tissue transfer is a reliable and safe method of soft-tissue augmentation. Nevertheless, the knowledge about graft behavior after transplantation remains inadequate. Especially the variation of long-term outcome and loss of transplanted volume represents a well-known disadvantageous phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There are several theories trying to explain this volume loss [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230265.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A plausible explanation for volume reduction is insufficient blood supply to the implanted adipose tissue at the site of transplantation. This might result in increased apoptosis and necrosis of the transplanted mature adipocytes due to their low tolerance to the potentially ischemic environment as well as slow vascularization rate [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is generally accepted that successful angiogenesis and neovascularization are essential for adipocyte survival and achieving a stable therapeutic outcome [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It has been shown that under normoxic conditions adipocytes and adipose tissue-derived stroma cells (ASCs) can survive longer than a week. However, after grafting of adipose tissue, adipocytes viability dramatically decreases and survive only 12 hours, whereas ASCs can survive 72 hours and viability rapidly decrease thereafter [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230265.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The plasmatic nutrient supply of adipocytes by diffusion takes place at a maximum tissue depth of 1.5 mm [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Under conditions of diffusion-dependent supply only 40% of adipose tissue survives at a depth of 1.5 mm [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Angiogenesis depends directly on the presence of suitable growth factors. Already after a short latency period, the germination vessels organize into a functioning capillary blood supply network that allows the survival of adipocytes [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Important trigger proteins of angiogenesis are the angiopoietins, which are secreted by adipose tissue depending on the status of differentiation and external stimuli. Growth factors also contribute to cell proliferation [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, <italic>basic fibroblast growth factor</italic> (bFGF), <italic>vascular endothelial growth factor</italic> (VEGF), and <italic>insulin-like growth factor</italic> (IGF) synergistically improve the growth of adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Growth factors substantially affect the stromal vascular fraction in the surrounding tissue [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] by enhancing vascularization and replacing fibrotic tissue with more supple tissue. In addition, growth factors promote precursor cell differentiation and neoangiogenesis thus enabling better volumetric results. More importantly, bFGF, IGF, and VEGF are tyrosine kinase receptor&#x02013;mediated growth factors that have been shown to improve transplantation results in animal studies. Thus, bFGF enhances the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230265.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and thus represents a strong mitogenic factor for adipocytes [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. IGF-1 significantly improves the results of autologous transfer of adipose tissue and survival of adipocytes [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Finally, VEGF promotes endothelial proliferation and migration, and substantially increases angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230265.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Due to these findings, it had been assumed that preconditioning of adipose tissue transplant with growth factors could represent an effective approach to prevent the mentioned volume loss after adipose tissue transplantation.</p><p>At this point it should also be mentioned that in addition to growth factors other substances, in particular derivatives of hyaluronic acid, can have a positive effect on ASCs. It has recently been shown that hyaluronan hybrid cooperative complexes (HCCs)-based formulations could significantly improve the adipogenic differentiation and proliferation of ASCs. Thus, injections of HCCs into the subdermal fat compartment led to an increased recruitment and differentiation of stem cells in adipocytes and thus significantly improved the renewal of the adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Previously, we have quantified naturally occurring levels of growth factors in isolated human adipose tissue. We could demonstrate that in cultured adipose tissue growth factor synthesis of bFGF, IGF-1, and VEGF remained nearly stable for several days [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although a positive role of growth factors in regenerative therapy approaches with adipose tissue is undisputed, until up today there is no data on the impact of adipose tissue growth factors concentration on proliferation and migration of its mesenchymal stroma cells (ASC). Therefore, in the present study we have investigated for the first time the relevance of the individual amount of naturally occurring growth factors in adipose tissue on the emigration and proliferation capacity of ASCs. Furthermore, we have evaluated the influence of exogenously applied growth factors on migration and proliferation of ASCs obtained from adipose tissues of donors with different adipose tissue growth factor concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material</title><p>If not indicated otherwise, all chemicals were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Samples and preparation</title><p>Eight adult white women and seven adult white men, aged 39.9&#x000b1;15.6 years, who had no major systemic metabolic diseases or lipid disorders were enrolled in this study.

Lipoaspirates were harvested from the abdomen by a single surgeon (S.R.C.) according to the Coleman protocol [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the adipose tissue was transferred directly to the laboratory for further analysis. Briefly, through a small incision at the lower abdominal donor site a mixed solution containing 0.5% lidocaine and 1:200.000 of epinephrine in lactated Ringer's solution was infiltrated by a blunt Lamis infiltrator (Byron Medical. lnc. Tucson. Ariz.). The amount of solution used was identical to the amount of fatty tissue transplant to be harvested. The harvest cannula (blunt tip, 3 mm diameter, 15 or 23 cm in length) was attached to a 10 ml Luer-Lok syringe. By pulling back on the plunger of a 10 ml syringe a slight negative pressure was produced and during fat collection the cannula was advanced and retracted through in the adipose tissue. After filling the syringe with the harvested adipose tissue the cannula was removed and the syringe was sealed with a Luer-Lok stopper. Then the plunger was removed from the syringe and the filled syringe was centrifuged in a centrifuge for 3 minutes at 190 g. After centrifugation the oil layer (top layer) was decanted and the upper aqueous layer was also drained from the syringe.

However, the successful use of fat grafting is often limited by the sometimes low and often unpredictable survival rates [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230265.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. As a result of the often-unsatisfactory results of adipose tissue grafts various experimental and clinical attempts have been made to increase survival rates of the implanted adipose tissue. For this purpose the transferred adipocytes were exposed to a more supportive biochemical environment, e. g. by adding growth factors [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some reports are indicative of the pivotal role of the naturally occurring levels of growth hormones in transplanted adipose tissue [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230265.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] as well as growth factor production of preadipocytes and its contribution to a successful outcome of adipose tissue transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230265.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Indeed, as shown by us previously, freshly isolated lipoaspirates show a considerable amount of IGF-1 and bFGF, and smaller quantities of VEGF [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that Insulin and IGF-1 stimulate adipocyte proliferation, differentiation, and trophic activities [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, bFGF can stimulate preadipocytes and fibroblasts on two levels, directly as mitogens for mesenchymal cells and indirectly as angiogenic factor [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. bFGF and VEGF can significantly accelerate the graft revascularization process and increase the vascular architecture of the grafted tissue. As a result, both growth factors can create an environment in which existing tissue is better supported and preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation is specifically promoted. Therefore, long term delivery of insulin, IGF-1, and bFGF is expected to successfully increase the weight maintenance of subdermally implanted autologous adipose tissue grafts [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. All these findings imply a positive correlation between the growth factor content of the adipose tissue sample and structural adipose tissue acceptance at the donor site. Thus, significant inter-individual differences in growth factor levels as measured by us previously [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] might explain reduced volume retention in some patients.</p><p>In the present study we affirm our previous observation of strong inter-individual differences in adipose tissue growth factor concentration upon the examined donor population. Thus we found an adipose tissue IGF concentration of 25&#x02013;450 pg/mg protein, bFGF of 60&#x02013;630 pg/mg protein, and VEGF of 7&#x02013;215 pg/mg protein. Interestingly and in contrast to our expectations, we found an inverse reciprocal correlation between the detected values of growth factor concentration of the characterized human adipose tissue samples and the proliferation and migration capacity of mesenchymal stroma cells (MSCs) obtained from the examined adipose tissue samples. Apparently paradoxical, we observed highest migration and proliferation values with mesenchymal stroma cells from adipose tissue containing the lowest values of growth factor content, whereas lowest migration and proliferation capacity of resident mesenchymal stroma cells could be found with fat lobules obtained from adipose tissue with the highest growth factor content.</p><p>In the last 10 years, the proliferation-increasing role of growth factors as well as their role in increasing the survival rate of MSCs has been extensively studied. The effect of most growth factors is pleiotrophic so that they can affect several biological factors simultaneously, e.g. motility, proliferation, morphogenesis and survival [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This is the reason why growth factors in regenerative medicine are frequently used to circumvent problems of MSC proliferation and expansion as well as survival <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Due to their synergistic effect, treatments with combinations of different growth factors are currently receiving particular attention.</p><p>Nevertheless, the wide-ranging biological roles of growth factors and the multitude of signaling pathways activated by them suggest that in the cell growth factor signaling must be tightly regulated, and positive but also negative feedback loops have been discovered in these pathways. Exemplarily, circulating IGF binds to its receptor (IGF-1R), which leads to the activation of Ras and AKT, two factors that directly lead to the up-regulation of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, AKT is also an upstream regulator of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and a downstream effector of mTORC2, whereby both mTOR variants playing an important role in positive and negative feedback on the IGF/AKT signaling pathway. While mTORC1 represents an indirect inhibitor of AKT activity [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], mTORC2 acts as an effective AKT activator [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>The FGF signaling cascade can be regulated at multiple levels by negative feedback mechanisms through the proteins Dual Specificity Phosphatases (DUSPs) and Spred and Sprouty [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In this case, the negative feedback mechanism mediated by DUSPs, Spred and Sprouty leads to the reduction or termination of the FGF signaling pathway [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Active FGF signaling thus promotes both a primed state and the expression of inhibitors of FGF signaling to create a negative feedback loop that would facilitate the return to the original unprimed state [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p><p>VEGF is one of the most important angiogenic factors. The biological effects of VEGF are mediated at the cellular level by its two membrane receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, there is also a soluble form of the receptor, sVEGFR-1, which can bind the free form of VEGF-A and thus acts as a potent anti-angiogenic factor [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In addition, because VEGF-A has been shown to upregulate sVEGF-R1 expression but does not affect the expression of VEGF-R1, such a VEGF-A mediated sVEGFR-1 upregulation can be considered as a negative feedback system of VEGF action [<xref rid="pone.0230265.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].</p><p>Concerning MSC proliferation and migration our results indicate a negative conditioning by higher growth factor concentrations in the MSC environing tissue. The assumption of a growth factor-dependent negative feedback mechanism on MSC obtained from adipose tissue containing elevated growth factor concentrations is further supported by our finding that exogenously applied recombinant growth factors did not have any significant effects on migration and proliferation capacity of those cells. In contrast, with fat lobules obtained from adipose tissue containing the lowest values of growth factor additional supplementation with recombinant growth factors led to significantly enhanced proliferation and migration of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stroma cells. Another convincing argument for our assumption described above is our observation that the high proliferation potential of cells from adipose tissue with low GF content (Q1) could be significantly reduced by a prolonged preincubation of the adipose tissue with high GF concentrations. The growth behavior of the Q1 MSCs was almost identical to the proliferation- impaired MSCs from adipose tissue with a very high GF content (Q4 lobules). So here we can give further indications that an exogenous GF environment can significantly prime the proliferation behavior of adipose tissue MSCs.</p><p>Our study shows for the first time that the capacity of mesenchymal stroma cells to spread out of isolated fat lobules as well as their proliferative potency depends inversely proportional on the growth factor content of the considered adipose tissue. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that recombinant growth factors were inefficient to enhance MSC proliferation and migration in adipose tissue samples exhibiting high growth factor contents. This indicates a growth factors-mediated negative feedback mechanism leading to an impaired growth factor answer of MSC obtained from adipose samples containing high growth factor concentration. Therefore, growth factor content of adipose tissue could serve as a predictive clinical parameter for the therapeutic outcome of autologous adipose tissue transfer. Our results implicate that in the case of low growth factor concentrations of the isolated adipose tissue a better therapeutic outcome of the adipose tissue graft could be expected. In this case, the attending physician would need to transplant less fatty tissue to get a good result. Additionally, in this case an additional supplementation with exogenously applied growth factors would make sense and even would improve the therapeutic outcome. In contrast, in the case of high growth factor concentration in the isolated adipose tissue sample, due to the lower proliferation and emigration capacity of the MSCs, it would be necessary to transplant a higher amount of adipose tissue material to achieve a comparable good result as mentioned above in the case of the first scenario. Concerning the clinical outcome however, supplementation with exogenous growth factors would make no sense and one would avoid additional burdening the patient with growth factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0230265.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Experimental setup.</title><p>In 15 freshly isolated individual adipose tissue samples we have quantified the amount of the three relevant growth factors IGF, bFGF, and VEGF.
