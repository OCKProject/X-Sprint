    "The increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are critical in the progression of atherosclerosis (AS). Platelet-derived growth factor type BB (PDGF-BB) may induce VSMC proliferation and migration. miR-142-5p plays a critical role in various biological processes, including tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and inflammation. However, whether miR-142-5p is involved in regulating the pathological process of arteriosclerosis remains to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, the role of miR-142-5p in PDGF-BB-induced human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSAMC) proliferation and migration was investigated. The results revealed that the expression level of miR-142-5p was enhanced in the serum of patients with AS, while that of its target gene, myocardin-like protein 2 (MKL2) was decreased, compared with that in healthy volunteers. Moreover, there was a negative correlation between miR-142-5p and MKL2 expression in the serum of patients with AS. Furthermore, the downregulation of miR-142-5p inhibited PDGF-BB-induced HASMC proliferation and migration; however, the inhibition of HASMC proliferation and migration was reversed by co-transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against MKL2 (siRNA-MKL2). In addition, transfection with miR-142-5p inhibitor significantly increased the expression levels of MKL2, and decreased those of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and 9, and these effects were reversed by transfection with siRNA-MKL2. Finally, MKL2 was proven to be a target of miR-142-5p. On the whole, the findings of the present study demonstrate that the downregulation of miR-142-5p inhibits human aortic smooth muscle cell (HSAMC) proliferation and migration possibly by targeting MKL2. Hence, miR-142-5p may prove to be a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of AS."
