    "OBJECTIVE:The interrelation and clinical utility of the parameters for superior migration of the humeral head, such as the acromiohumeral interval (AHI), inferior glenohumeral distance (IGHD), and upward migration index (UMI), in the management of massive rotator cuff tears are not clear. The objectives of this study were to identify the relation between AHI, IGHD, and UMI when measured with radiography and MRI and to determine whether superior migration can predict the irreparability of massive rotator cuff tears. METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed the files of 64 consecutive patients who underwent arthroscopic partial or complete repair for massive rotator cuff tears at our institution between August 2015 and August 2018. We recorded both radiography and MRI measurements of AHI, IGHD, and UMI, and further the tangent sign, fatty infiltration of the rotator cuff muscles, and the Patte grade. We performed correlation assessments and multiple logistic regression analysis to identify potential predictors of the reparability of massive rotator cuff tears. RESULTS:Thirty-five patients had partially reparable and 29 had completely reparable tears. Parameters measured with either radiography or MRI were highly correlated with each other. The radiographic measurements showed a moderate or low correlation with the MRI measurements. All parameters of superior migration of the humeral head on radiography and MRI, the tangent sign, fatty infiltration of the infraspinatus muscle, and the Patte grade showed significant differences between patients with partially and completely repaired tears. Among these, the independent predictors for irreparability was Patte grade = 3. CONCLUSION:The AHI, IGHD, and UMI were highly correlated when measured with either radiography or MRI, but not when comparing their radiographic with their MRI values. Furthermore, they were not independent indicators of reparability in massive rotator cuff tears."
