NIS is a theranostic protein that allows non-invasive monitoring of the <italic>in vivo</italic> biodistribution of functional NIS expression by radioiodine imaging as well as the therapeutic application of <sup>131</sup>I. To enhance the actively recruitment of MSCs to growing tumor stroma and thereby trigger targeted delivery of the NIS gene to the tumor, we examined the combination with regional hyperthermia, as heat induces the secretion of immunomodulatory chemokines, cytokines and growth factors, well-known attractants of MSCs.</p><p>Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HuH7) were heat-treated in a water bath at 41 &#x000b0;C for 1h, followed by incubation at 37 &#x000b0;C for 0-48h. mRNA and protein levels of chemokines involved in MSC migration was analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA. Chemotaxis of MSCs in relation to a gradient of supernatants was tested in a 3D live cell tracking migration assay. In a subcutaneous HuH7 mouse xenograft tumor model, a single systemic injection of CMV-NIS-MSCs was applied 6h, 24h, 48h after or 24h, 48h before hyperthermia treatment and tumoral <sup>123</sup>I accumulation was assessed by <sup>123</sup>I-scintigraphy. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> NIS analysis of tumor sections was performed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The optimal imaging regime was then used for a <sup>131</sup>I therapy study.</p><p>Chemokine mRNA and protein analysis indicated a substantial increase in expression levels of chemokines and growth factors, involved in MSC tumor homing, after heat exposure. In addition, MSCs showed directed migration towards the supernatant of thermo-stimulated cancer cells. <italic>In vivo</italic>, with the optimal regime, we observed a significantly increased uptake of <sup>123</sup>I in tumors of heat-treated animals (41 &#x000b0;C) when thermostimulated 24h after CMV-NIS-MSC injection compared to control animals (37 &#x000b0;C). Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections showed strong tumoral NIS-specific immunoreactivity and RT-PCR an increased NIS mRNA expression in heat-treated tumors, thereby confirming tumor-selective, temperature-dependent MSC migration. CMV-NIS-MSC-mediated <sup>131</sup>I therapy combined with regional hyperthermia resulted in a reduced tumor growth that was associated with prolonged survival of regional heat-treated animals compared to normothermic mice and to the saline control group.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated a significantly increased, selective MSC migration towards the tumor stroma after regional hyperthermia in the <sup>123</sup>I imaging study. The combination of MSC-mediated NIS gene therapy with mild regional hyperthermia resulting in stimulated therapeutic efficacy of NIS-mediated <sup>131</sup>I therapy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
