The present work seeks to investigate the effect of Kelulut honey (KH) on TGF&#x003b2;-induced EMT in human primary keratinocytes. Image analysis of the real time observation of TGF&#x003b2;-induced keratinocytes revealed a faster wound closure and individual migration velocity compared to the untreated control. TGF&#x003b2;-induced keratinocytes also have reduced circularity and display a classic EMT protein expression. Treatment of 0.0015% (<italic>v</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) KH reverses these effects. In untreated keratinocytes, KH resulted in slower initial wound closure and individual migration velocity, which sped up later on, resulting in greater wound closure at the final time point. KH treatment also led to greater directional migration compared to the control. KH treatment caused reduced circularity in keratinocytes but displayed a partial EMT protein expression. Taken together, the findings suggest the therapeutic potential of KH in preventing keloid scar by attenuating TGF&#x003b2;-induced EMT.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>honey</kwd><kwd>cell morphology</kwd><kwd>scratch assay</kwd><kwd>keloid scar</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>wound healing</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijerph-17-03229"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Over-induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;) in keratinocytes is a key feature in scarred wound and keloid formation [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Keloid is the formation of excessive fibrous tissue during the process of cutaneous wound healing. It can extend beyond the original wound borders, resulting in disfiguring scar [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In extreme cases, keloid scarring can cause significant morbidity due to decreased range of motion, pain, itching, and impaired self-image and quality of life [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>EMT has been implicated as an important event during the re-epithelialization process of wound healing [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. EMT allows immotile epithelial cells to assume motile mesenchymal-like cells phenotype to migrate over the wound bed. EMT key features are the loss of epithelial integrity and gain of mesenchymal cell motility. The phenotypic transition of the cells is typically marked by the reduction of molecular marker that represents the epithelial state such as E-cadherin, or the elevation of molecular marker that represents the mesenchymal state such as vimentin [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, efforts to describe the cell phenotypic state beyond the conventional molecular and genetic markers have started to gain attention [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Advancements in the imaging technology and image analysis methodology enable the quantification of morphological parameters such as wound closure rate, migration speed, and migration directionality. These parameters can be used to describe the step-wise transitional dynamic of the different cell state, instead of a singular endpoint achieved with destructive molecular evaluation [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This helps in establishing the conceptual framework required to understand the much more complex nature of the in vivo behavior of keratinocytes during the EMT process. Furthermore, availability of open access image analysis software such as ImageJ by the National Institute of Health US, may be a more cost-effective alternative in understanding the EMT process [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>TGF&#x003b2; has been known to be a potent inducer of EMT in many epithelial cells such as the airway epithelial and corneal epithelial cells [<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Hanh et al (2016) had shown that keratinocytes derived from a keloid scar, exhibit similar behavior to the normal keratinocytes when TGF&#x003b2; was inhibited. This suggests that the keloid scar formation is caused by the overexpression of TGF&#x003b2; during the wound healing process. Upon further investigation of the markers of EMT, they concluded that the keloid-derived keratinocytes displayed features of a partial EMT [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In terms of therapeutic target for skin fibrosis, O&#x02019; Kane et al (2014) had previously shown that the inhibition of the SMAD signaling was able to reverse the EMT-activation of TGF&#x003b2;-induced keratinocytes [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Applications of small molecule drug in keloid scar treatment might be costly and may result in adverse effects. Thus, application of natural product as an alternative might prove to be more cost-effective and safer.</p><p>Use of honey as wound treatment ailment can be dated back to ancient Egypt [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Reports regarding the efficacy of honey in the clinical setting can be found from as early as 1966 covering wide range of wound types [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At the cellular level, honey has been proven to benefit various cellular components of wound healing such as keratinocytes [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], fibroblasts [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], macrophages [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and endothelial cells [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In keratinocytes, honey has been reported to modulate keratinocytes&#x02019; proliferation [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], migration [<xref rid="B19-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and it&#x02019;s epithelial to mesenchymal transition [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In Malaysia, the stingless bee is a more common honey producer compared to their sting bee counterparts. Stingless bee can be found in the backyards of many villagers all around the country. The stingless bee is locally known as Kelulut. Previously, we have reported a positive influence of our Kelulut honey (KH) on dermal fibroblasts [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The current study has a twofold objective. First, we aim to define the cellular dynamics during EMT using quantitative morphological parameters following TGF&#x003b2;-induction in human primary keratinocytes.

KH caused 50% inhibition of cell viability at half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 1.56%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-03229-f003">Figure 3</xref>A depicts the dose-response curve of KH and the epidermal keratinocyte cell viability.</p><p>Following the dose-response curve, the lowest concentration (0.0015%) and the IC<sub>50</sub> concentration (1.56%) were chosen to evaluate the effect of KH on keratinocytes cell proliferation upon long-term exposure.

Discussion</title><p>The current study revealed enhancement of the colonization of wound defects by keratinocytes, and their migration velocity by TGF&#x003b2; induction. Alternatively, TGF&#x003b2; induction also caused diminution of cell circularity into a mesenchymal-like spindle shape. When protein expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker vimentin was evaluated, TGF&#x003b2; induction resulted in the classical EMT indicator of E-cadherin downregulation and vimentin upregulation. Our results suggest the validity of the quantitative morphological parameters to be used as indicator of EMT activation in human primary keratinocytes.</p><p>Enhancement of the keratinocytes wound closure in vitro by TGF&#x003b2; induction has been reported previously. Hanh et al. (2013) induced normal keratinocytes with TGF&#x003b2; to mimic the keratinocytes derived from keloid scar. Indeed, TGF&#x003b2; induction caused the keratinocytes to colonize the wound defect faster than their untreated counterparts [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Absence of TGF&#x003b2; gene has also been implicated with non-healing wounds. Pastar et al. (2010) found that the TGF&#x003b2; signaling is functionally blocked in non-healing venous ulcer [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This highlights the importance of the balance in TGF&#x003b2; signaling to achieve a complete and proper wound healing.</p><p>KH treatment was able to reverse the TGF&#x003b2; induced wound closure enhancement. This suggests the therapeutic potential of KH to prevent over-induction of wound healing. Over-induction of wound healing is a characteristic of keloid scar [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hence, KH has the potential to be used as anti-keloid agent. In untreated keratinocytes, KH seems to slow down the wound closure in the earlier time points. However, this effect was not significant and could be due by the variation of the initial wound size.</p><p>Treatment of 5 to 20 ng/mL TGF&#x003b2; demonstrated dose-dependent effect on the magnitude of EMT in respiratory epithelial cell [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similar effect was observed during the optimization stage of the current study (Data not shown). Since EMT is a reversible phenomenon, the reversal could be caused by the smaller magnitude of effect exerted by the 5 ng/mL TGF&#x003b2;. A higher concentration of TGF&#x003b2; could result in more persistent EMT and renders KH unable to reverse its effect.</p><p>A longstanding hypothesis of EMT in the context of wound healing is that it allows immotile epithelial cells to assume motile mesenchymal-like cells phenotype, to migrate over the wound bed [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, increase in motility following TGF&#x003b2; induction is expected. The increased migration velocity induced by TGF&#x003b2; confirms the wound closure result. When keratinocytes migrate faster, they can colonize the wound defect faster. However, the increased migration velocity may indicate the over-induction of wound healing, a feature of keloid scarring [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As such, increased keratinocytes migration velocity can be an indicator of keloid wound healing.</p><p>KH treatment was able to reverse the TGF&#x003b2; induced increase of migration velocity. This finding supports the aforementioned therapeutic potential of KH as an anti-keloid agent. In untreated keratinocytes, KH seems to slow down the migration velocity only in the earliest time points. This pattern of initial slow migration followed by a subsequent faster migration was in accordance to the wound closure result with KH in untreated keratinocytes.</p><p>One of the features of EMT is the loss of apical-basal polarity of the cells. This caused the circularity of the cell to reduce when observed under light microscope. The decreased in the circularity index of the keratinocytes in culture indicate the endpoint outcome of EMT occurrence. Circularity parameters have been included in reports of the EMT study in the neoplasm context [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, it has not been seen in any EMT study in the wound healing context. In this study, we demonstrated the reliability of circularity parameters as an indicator of EMT activation.</p><p>Similar to what was reported by Hanh et al. (2016) and O&#x02019;Kane et al. (2014), we were able to demonstrate the hallmark reduction of E-cadherin and elevation of vimentin with TGF&#x003b2; induction in keratinocytes [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most of the EMT study, include a wide array of molecular markers to evaluate EMT occurrence. In this study, only two markers were used and this might affect the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>At the transcriptional level, E-cadherin production is inhibited by the transcriptional factors Snail and Slug. Simultaneously, elevation of Snail and Slug also resulted in elevation of vimentin [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The partial EMT exhibited by KH suggested that it modulates the process circumventing the Snail and Slug transcription factors. However, it could also mean that KH might still induce Snail and Slug but prevents elevation of vimentin in other pathways. This can be answered by measuring the level of Snail and Slug expression.</p><p>In addition to Snail and Slug, EMT is also regulated by basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and zinc-finger E-box-binding (ZEB) transcription factors. Multiple signaling pathways cooperate in the initiation and progression of EMT including Smad, Rho-like GTPases, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) [<xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. One of the advantages of in vitro cellular model such as the one in the current study is the ability to induce and inhibit specific signaling molecules to investigate its role in the action reported. Elucidating the molecular mechanism underlying the KH effect on EMT can be of great interest.</p><p>Honey has been implicated with the EMT process of wound healing. Upon monitoring the gene expression during re-epithelialization of keratinocytes, Ranzato et al. (2012) revealed that the treatment of honey, upregulated both the E-cadherin and vimentin expression [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This suggests that honey enhances keratinocyte migration while simultaneously maintaining epithelial integrity. In this study, KH treatment downregulated the E-cadherin but did not affect vimentin expression. We hypothesized that our keratinocytes lose their epithelial integrity without any cytoskeletal changes that may over-enhance their migration. This hypothesis was supported by the observation of initial slower migration, which sped up later on resulting in greater wound closure at the later time point. Taken together, the results revealed a differential effect of honey in a different context of the cell phenotypic state.</p><p>Directionality of the cell migration can play an important role in wound healing. A cell that moves at a greater distance might not necessarily be moving efficiently; either through taking larger and more variable steps, or not migrating in a straight path [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Factors that influence EMT such as the absence of Ovol gene, have been reported to affect directionality of cell migration [<xref rid="B30-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, there was no difference in terms of directionality between TGF&#x003b2; induced keratinocytes and its untreated counterparts observed in this study. The greater directional migration observed in KH treatment in untreated keratinocytes, could be the result of partial modulation of the EMT by KH. In the control, cytoskeletal changes indicated by the upregulation of vimentin, may cause the individual keratinocytes to move more randomly compare to the unchanged cytoskeleton in KH treated keratinocytes.</p><p>The current study reported the safety of KH at low dosage. Inhibitory concentration at half maximal survival, or known as IC<sub>50</sub>, is a method employed to determine the toxic dose of a particular drug after a short exposure [<xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Among the safety dose of honey, we chose the lowest dose in our study, 0.0015%, to evaluate the effect of honey on other parameters of wound healing. The lowest dose was chosen to consider the cost-effectiveness of the final therapeutic product developed in the future.</p><p>In terms of the dose response viability, a study using Gelam honey and corneal keratocytes reported the same findings as the current study [<xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Glucose constitutes 30% of the stingless bee honey mass [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In cell metabolism, glucose acts a major source of energy. In the event of its excess, accumulation of oxidative stress from glucose auto-oxidation, non-enzymatic glycation, the formation of advanced glycation end products, and the overproduction of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria can occur [<xref rid="B34-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These result in cytotoxicity instead of maintenance of the cell metabolism.</p><p>Furthermore, the acidity of honey might also influence cell viability in culture [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A balanced and stable pH, between 7.2 to 7.4 are ideal for nearly all cells in culture [<xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-03229" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Hence, a disruption in the cell culture media pH can impede the cell viability and growth. However, addition of honey into the cell culture medium did not change the pH of the culture medium (data not shown). This could be due to the buffer included in the formulation of the culture media.</p><p>Long-term exposure of the keratinocytes cells with KH reinforced the results of the dose response study. KH at 0.0015% was able to maintain cell viability over time comparable to the control. As expected, the IC50 dose, 1.56% honey, resulted in the inhibition of the keratinocyte proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-17-03229"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the current study established the reliability of quantitative morphological parameters in describing the cellular dynamics during EMT. More importantly, the cellular phenotypic transition during EMT can be attenuated by KH. Taken together, the findings demonstrated the potential of KH to be used in scar-less wound healing application. This preliminary in vitro work should be supplemented with pre-clinical and clinical study in hypertrophic or keloid scar.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge Trigona Bee Sdn.
