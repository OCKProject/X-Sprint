Data on ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) was obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Census data was used to calculate rates of within-country migration at the district level. We calculated differences in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure between &#x0201c;current&#x0201d; (2016&#x02013;2017) and &#x0201c;origin&#x0201d; (2012) districts for each migration patterns. Using an exposure-response relationship for PM<sub>2.5</sub> extracted from a meta-analysis, and mortality rates from the Peruvian Ministry of Health, we quantified premature mortality attributable to each migration pattern. Changes in outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure were observed between 2012 and 2016 with highest levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Department of Lima. A strong spatial autocorrelation of outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> values (Moran&#x02019;s I&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.847, p-value=0.001) was observed. In Greater Lima, rural-to-urban and urban-to-urban migrants experienced 10-fold increases in outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure in comparison with non-migrants. Changes in outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure due to migration drove 137.1 (95%CI: 93.2, 179.4) premature deaths related to air pollution, with rural-urban producing the highest risk of mortality from exposure to higher levels of ambient air pollution. Our results demonstrate that the rural-urban and urban-urban migrant groups have higher rates of air pollution-related deaths.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Environmental impact</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000061</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &#x00026; Human Services | NIH | Fogarty International Center (FIC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D43 TW007120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carrasco-Escobar</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Migration is increasingly recognized as an important determinant for population health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Nowadays, more than 244 million international migrants are estimated globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> with considerable gaps in health care services. Furthermore, a significantly larger number of internal migrants &#x02212; people moving within their country of birth &#x02212; has been documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, with a particular health burden despite being nationals. Migrants are commonly exposed to a range of challenges such as low quality of labor conditions, massive vehicular traffic, sedentarism (low level of physical activity), lack of social support, limited access to healthy food choices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Social vulnerability from economic instability, social isolation, poor access to healthcare services, increased exposure to infectious diseases, and traumatic events related to the migration itself have also been known to affect migrants&#x02019; health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In addition to these stressors, migrants are exposed to new environments, which may have further impacts. Environmental changes and exposures have been studied as drivers of migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, including how exposure to hazards or availability of ecosystem services can lead residents&#x02019; to migrate away from these harmful environments. Although there is abundant literature studying how environmental hazards can drive emigration, only one study conducted in the United States (U.S.) has investigated how migrants may also be at a differential risk for environmental exposures. Interestingly, this study found that international immigrants in the U.S. are generally less exposed to chemical toxins, while specific groups such as Mexican immigrants in high income areas have a disproportionate exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

The burden of air pollutants is 6.4 million years of life lost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Most health effects of air pollution have been documented in respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, allergenic diseases, and diabetes, affecting individuals throughout the life course from developing fetuses to elderly populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Particulate matter under 2.5 micrometers (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is known to be one of the more harmful pollutants due to its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. With major increases in urbanization and migration to urban centers worldwide, which have higher levels of air pollution and other environmental exposures, the potential health implications of these changes and burden of migrant populations merits attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

However, slow process of formal land titles and rising property prices in Lima have led some recent migrants to poor housing conditions in shantytowns with lack of water or electricity supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

The &#x0201c;current&#x0201d; department mortality rate was used for analysis to account for potential changes in baseline mortality between departments, to focus only on changes in outdoor air pollution exposure. For example, for those migrants that lived in Chachapoyas, Amazonas in 2012 and moved to Chorrillos, Lima in 2016, an ambient air pollution difference was considered at the district-level by considering the change in exposure between Chachapoyas and Chorrillos. This difference in ambient air pollution exposure was then multiplied by the mortality rate for the department of Lima which was considered homogenous and therefore assigned to the district of Chorrillos, and by the AF. This was considered the excess mortality for this migrant group, and differences were calculated for each migration pattern and weighted by the number of individuals that undertook this migration route to calculate average mortality rates from air pollution exposure attributable to migration. Finally, overall number of attributable deaths were calculated by taking into account the number of migrants that undertook each district-district route. 95% Confidence intervals were computed by calculating the attributable mortality based on variability of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> ERF.

When considering only those that migrate from a rural-to-urban setting, there is an increase in 118 (95%CI: 80, 154) deaths related to outdoor air pollution. The largest migrant group, urban-to-urban, resulted in an increase in 62 (95%CI: 42, 81) ambient air pollution-related deaths, while the smallest migrant group, rural to rural, results in 0.5 (95%CI: 0.4, 0.7) additional deaths.

Migrants are a particularly vulnerable group in this context as they are moving to areas with higher or worse environmental risk profiles, often driven by economic, socio-political or geographical motives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Besides changes in customs and risk behaviors, migrants also experience a change in environment. This study showed the first evidence of the relationship between changes in outdoor air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) exposure and burden related to migration status. Remarkable clustering patterns were observed in the spatial distribution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and migration rates. These distributions are spatially correlated in densely urban areas. This study highlights that rural-to-urban as well as urban-urban migrants experience a transition to environments with more deleterious ambient air pollution levels with a higher mortality burden, which adds to other previously reported socio-economic disadvantages. Additionally, although urban-to-urban migrants experience what may seem like a small change in exposure to particulate matter, this is associated with a considerable mortality burden, taking into account the important number of migrants that undertake this route. This demonstrates that even a slight increase in outdoor air pollution exposure associated with migration can have large impacts on population health, particularly when large groups are moving to environments with higher outdoor air pollution concentrations. The results of this study are important, because 1) it is the first study to quantify the effect of outdoor air pollution exposure on migrants health, and 2) it allows an understanding mobility and exposure patterns in Peru that can be integrated into urban planning policies to protect vulnerable populations.</p><p id="Par29">Previous studies in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> and the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> have argued that environmental inequalities may be shaped by social mechanisms such as residential segregation and racial income inequality. These same mechanisms were hypothesized in this study. In Greater Lima, the city that harbor most internal immigrants, the highest levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> are located in districts with the lowest average income. Albeit less marked than observed with PM<sub>2.5</sub>, districts with the highest migration rates are concurrently the most impoverished areas. Recent studies characterized the Peruvian internal migrants as primarily low-income population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, similar to other studies worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Taken together, the evidence points to the fact that the main mechanisms that drive migration and consequently higher PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure levels and burden are poverty and seeking of economic and educational opportunities. Many low-income rural populations are migrating to deleterious urban environments seeking better economic and educational opportunities but are exposed to much higher levels of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and increased mortality risk. By identifying Lima as the department in Peru that far exceeds outdoor air pollution-related mortality burden for migrants, it can be considered a priority area for targeted ambient air pollution control measures, particularly for migrating populations.</p><p id="Par30">Previous studies have described the effects of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in non-communicable diseases (NCD), and respiratory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.

Conditions such as soil organic matter, industry, and traffic have been suggested as drivers to the increased outdoor air pollution level which is attributed as a major determinant to the quality of life in the megacity of Lima<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. As portrayed in the spatial analysis, hotspots of ambient air pollution are located on the coast of the country. Furthermore, these areas are located near main ports and heavily industrialized areas. These findings urge for new environmental health strategies to control these detrimental conditions. This study was able to exploit the different migration patterns and its associated health burden driven by changes in ambient air pollution exposure. Political commitment to address these issues will have a positive effect in reducing environmental-related health outcomes and the social and environmental gap observed in the migrant population.</p><p id="Par31">This study is the first to describe a positive relation between internal migration and ambient air pollution exposure, and quantify the associated burden. Is important to mention that the social structure and social capital is also altered in the migrant population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. These conditions may deter the response capacity of the migrant population to affront environmental hazards for which recent migrants are exposed. However, it is important to acknowledge that migrants, and particularly those moving from rural to urban areas, may also experience increased economic opportunities and accessibility to healthcare. For example, financial reasons and other motivations related to improving people&#x02019;s well-being is a strong driver of out-migration which may have a positive impact on the overall health of the migrant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Although there are some nuances in the health effects of migration, it was beyond the scope of this study to consider these other factors, as the main purpose of this study was to quantify the outdoor air pollution-related health burden. Ultimately, it is well established that migrant populations in Peru are highly vulnerable to diseases due to environmental, social, and economic frailty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and ambient air pollution exposure adds to this existing burden.</p><p id="Par32">This manuscript focuses specifically on changes in outdoor ambient air pollution.

Migration from rural to urban areas for example may have a beneficial effect on exposure to indoor air pollution due to changes in cooking fuels. Although we did not have access to such data, previous studies in Peru have found that indoor biomass stove can increase exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and particulate matter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Additionally, while these are two different sources of exposure, interventions aimed at reducing residential wood burning have also been shown to reduce outdoor particulate matter concentrations showing important health benefits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">Additional work could expand the exploration of other drivers of health and health changes, particularly for migrant populations, including other environmental exposures, potential positive changes in accessibility to healthcare and services as well as changes in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure related to other internal migrant groups or external migration. However, in comparison to refugee migration, internal migration can be more precisely estimated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup> due to the fact that mechanisms that influence internal migration follow long-term trends. However, the technical challenges to harmonize temporal and spatial data of internal displacements often prevents accurate quantification of internal migrants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Furthermore, limited evidence showed the impact of internal migration on exposure to deleterious environments. The spatial autocorrelation analysis in this study has shown the large spatial effects in the relation between migration and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. These spatial effects might be due to social, economic, environmental (topological), or behavioral characteristics in the districts that receive the most migrants. This elucidates important evidence that geographically targeted interventions may have a great impact at the macro- and micro- scales.</p><p id="Par34">Several limitations should be acknowledged in this study. First, migration estimates were computed based on whether the participant lived in the same district five years before. This cutoff is based on the census questionnaire and may represent a threat to consistency, due to the wide range from 5 years before to recent migrants (~1 day). Second, there is no question to check if participants are currently living in a permanent or temporary household, thus we cannot ascertain if they had a chronic exposure to these levels of outdoor air pollution. In the same way, migrants may arrive at a different place than where they were interviewed, and thus they may carry over the environmental exposures of all previous places where they had been settled that may yield to exposure misclassification. Third, as detected in the high-resolution images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for reference), high variability of outdoor air pollution was observed within each district. Due to the lack of spatial resolution of migration status, ambient air pollution data was aggregated at the district level to be harmonized with migration data. This may yield biased conclusions due to PM<sub>2.5</sub> and migration being non-stationary processes within districts. Further studies are suggested that account for fine-scale estimation of the relationship between migration and outdoor air pollution exposure. Also, despite residency exposure being a standard measure for ambient air pollution, this does not account for total exposure to air pollutants. This study did not include the exposure during work or leisure activities due to the lack of this data in the census. Additionally, we assumed a exposure-response relationship of PM<sub>2.5</sub> based on existing literature on long-term effects of particulate matter based on studies primarily conducted in North America and Europe, while the true relationship may be different in the Peruvian context. However, the risk would be likely to be an underestimation as the majority of studies in the meta-analysis were from North America or Europe while impacts have been shown to be higher in Peru and other underrepresented countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Lastly, the baseline mortality rate considered for calculating attributable mortality risk was available only at the departmental level, therefore we had to assume homogeneity in mortality rates for districts within each department.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par35">This study was able to demonstrate the effect of migration on change in exposure to air pollution and quantify the mortality burden from this change. The clustered co-occurrence of high values of migration and PM<sub>2.5</sub> suggest this relation might be shaped also by social and economic inequalities. Results suggest that internal migration in Peru drives an increase in mortality from air pollution exposure, with rural-urban migrants as one of the most vulnerable migrant groups, as well as the most prevalent. The findings of this study may represent the first steps to tailor strategies to improve the health of vulnerable populations such as internal migrants. Additionally, our results demonstrate the importance of considering air pollution as an environmental risk factors when studying migrant health in Peru and beyond.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
