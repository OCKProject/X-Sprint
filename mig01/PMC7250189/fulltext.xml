Targeted drugs have been developed in lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) for patients with driven gene positive patients such as epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS proto-oncogene 1(ROS1) rearrangements to inhibit tumor progression. However, the advance of targeted therapy in Lung squamous cell cancer (LSCC) is rare. Therefore, it is critical and urgent to identify the molecular mechanism underlying the occurrence and development of LSCC to explore the drug-able driver genes for the future strategies.</p><p>Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a transmembrane protein and member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family [<xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. It is known that FGFR1 can promote tumor progression and invasion in various cancers including gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer [<xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>]. In previous studies, our group has demonstrated that FGFR1 interacted with Gli2, SOX2 and YAP to maintain stemness or EMT in FGFR1 amplified lung cancer, especially in LSCC [<xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010">10</xref>]. FGFR1 amplification is the most common type in the FGFR1 dysfunction, with 20% in LSCC, 5&#x02013;7% in SCLC, and 1&#x02013;3% in LADC [<xref rid="CIT0011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. As a promising candidate in LSCC, small molecule drugs targeting FGFR1 were developed. BGJ398 and AZD4547 are selective inhibitors of FGFR 1&#x02013;3 in phase Ib clinical trials [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0016">16</xref>]. However, the efficacy of these inhibitors are modest [<xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>].</p><p>The D-type cyclins family members (D1, D2, and D3) along with its binding partners CDK 4/6 partially regulate G1 to S-phase transition of the cell cycle [<xref rid="CIT0020">20</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021">21</xref>]. More than 35 distinct transcription factors are regulated by CCND1 expression [<xref rid="CIT0022">22</xref>]. The oncogenic roles of the CCND1 have been demonstrated in various studies, with numerous human cancers including thyroid breast, LADC, liver, colon, and prostate, overexpress CCND1 [<xref rid="CIT0023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0027">27</xref>]. Notably, 1/3 of FGFR1-amplified tumors harbor amplification of CCND1 in breast cancer [<xref rid="CIT0028">28</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0029">29</xref>]. FGFR1 overexpression promotes resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Moreover, CCND1 may mediate FGFR1-induced drug resistance in ER+ breast cancer [<xref rid="CIT0030">30</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>]. However, few reports discussed the potential molecular mechanism between CCND1 and FGFR1 in FGFR amplified LSCC. Meanwhile, we found that higher expression of CCND1 predicted shorter OS in LSCC. Meanwhile, the expression of CCND1 wasn&#x02019;t associated with OS in LADC. Therefore, as promising targets in LSCC, there is an urgent need to further explore the development and progression of CCND1 and FGFR1 in LSCC.</p><p>We hypothesis for the first time that CCND1 interacts with FGFR1 to promote EMT in LSCC in in vitro and in vivo.

In this study, we showed for the first time that CCND1 strongly modulates the EMT phenotypes of LSCC. Thus, this provides strong evidence that CCND1 can serve not only as a prognostic marker, but also as a useful target in therapies against FGFR1-amplified LSCC.</p><p>The molecular etiology of lung cancer is complex, with a diverse reorganization of gene expression patterns promoting stemness and suppressing differentiation. It has long been recognized that FGFRs are overexpressed in various types of tumor, including lung cancer, breast cancer and oral SQCC [<xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0040">40</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0041">41</xref>]. As mentioned above, FGFR1 as an attractive target demonstrated modest response [<xref rid="CIT0042">42</xref>]. Therefore, signaling paradigm co-alternation with FGFR1 or genes have been widely studied, such as the co-active receptor tyrosine kinases, the co-activation of MTOR pathway, et al. [<xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0043">43</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0044">44</xref>]. We demonstrated the co-expression of FGFR1 and CCND1 in lung cancer.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that FGFR1 could regulate MAPK/PI3K-AKT signaling [<xref rid="CIT0045">45</xref>]. We confirmed that CCND1 activated the activity of MAPK/PI3K-AKT signaling, and overexpression of CCND1 offs the this effect of FGFR1 on MAPK/PI3K-AKT signaling, which suggest that FGFR1 partial inhibited MAPK/PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by suppression of CCND1.</p><p>Meanwhile, FGFR1 amplification/overexpression was reported as a mechanism of resistance to treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with antiestrogens [<xref rid="CIT0031">31</xref>]. Given that, we explored the efficiency of co-target CCND-1 and FGFR1. Here, we confirmed the antitumor synergism between si-CCND1 and FGFR1 inhibitor AZD4547 in vitro and in vivo. In the cell experiment, the CI index is about 0.15, showing a strong synergistic effect. Furthermore, subcutaneous and orthotopic lung cancer models also confirmed the synergistic effect. The mechanism of the synergistic effect remains unclear, and we found FGFR1 inhibitor AZD4547 sharply downregulated the level of CCND1. The inhibitory effect of AZD4547 and si-RNA on CCND1 might be synergistic, which need further exploration.</p><p>Despite current studies pointing to the fact that CCND1 is overexpressed and activated in a variety of cancers [<xref rid="CIT0046">46</xref>], few reports discuss the underlying molecular mechanisms by which CCND1 is regulated or activated in malignant tumors, especially in FGFR1 amplified lung cancer. Notably, our efforts focused on an in vivo orthotropic mouse model, which closely mimics the clinical features of human lung cancer and clarifies that CCND1 plays a pivotal role in the initiation and metastasis of lung cancer.</p><p>In this study, we found that both nuclear CCND1 and FGFR1 protein expression are correlated and unregulated in LSCC.
