    "Objective:To explore the role and mechanism of BKCa in diabetic kidney disease. Methods:Rat mesangial cells (MCs) HBZY-1 were cultured with high glucose to simulate the high-glucose environment of diabetic kidney disease in vivo. The effects of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BKCa) on proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HBZY-1 cells were observed. The contents of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), Smad2/3, collagen IV (Col IV), and fibronectin (FN) in the extracellular matrix were also observed. Results:High glucose significantly damaged HBZY-1 cells, which enhanced the ability of cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis, and increased the secretion of Col IV and FN. Inhibition of BKCa and TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways can inhibit the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HBZY-1 cells and suppress the secretion of Col IV and FN. The effect of excitation is the opposite. Conclusions:BKCa regulates mesangial cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and secretion of Col IV and FN and is associated with TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway."
