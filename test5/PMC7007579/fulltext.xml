Our approach of observing the experimental evolution of sibling interactions in real time reveals three key insights. First, when parents provide parental care, siblings evolve to compete. Parental care compensates for the costs of sibling rivalry. Second, when parents do not supply care, siblings evolve to cooperate. Sibling cooperation compensates for the loss of parental care. Third, rapid evolutionary switching between sibling rivalry and sibling cooperation is possible because siblings induce greater levels of rivalry (or cooperation) in each other. This generates positive evolutionary feedback, rapidly locking larvae into evolving greater levels of competition (or cooperation) in the presence (or absence) of parental care.</p></abstract><abstract><p>Sibling rivalry is commonplace within animal families, yet offspring can also work together to promote each other&#x02019;s fitness. Here we show that the extent of parental care can determine whether siblings evolve to compete or to cooperate. Our experiments focus on the burying beetle <italic>Nicrophorus vespilloides</italic>, which naturally provides variable levels of care to its larvae. We evolved replicate populations of burying beetles under two different regimes of parental care: Some populations were allowed to supply posthatching care to their young (Full Care), while others were not (No Care). After 22 generations of experimental evolution, we found that No Care larvae had evolved to be more cooperative, whereas Full Care larvae were more competitive. Greater levels of cooperation among larvae compensated for the fitness costs caused by parental absence, whereas parental care fully compensated for the fitness costs of sibling rivalry. We dissected the evolutionary mechanisms underlying these responses by measuring indirect genetic effects (IGEs) that occur when different sibling social environments induce the expression of more cooperative (or more competitive) behavior in focal larvae. We found that indirect genetic effects create a tipping point in the evolution of larval social behavior. Once the majority of offspring in a brood start to express cooperative (or competitive) behavior, they induce greater levels of cooperation (or competition) in their siblings. The resulting positive feedback loops rapidly lock larvae into evolving greater levels of cooperation in the absence of parental care and greater levels of rivalry when parents provide care.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>indirect genetic effect</kwd><kwd>cooperation</kwd><kwd>competition</kwd><kwd>parental care</kwd><kwd>burying beetle</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">EC | FP7 | FP7 Ideas: European Research Council (FP7 Ideas)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100011199</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">310785</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Rebecca M Kilner</principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="gs2"><funding-source id="sp2">RCUK | Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)<named-content content-type="funder-id">501100000270</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">NE/L011255/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Nathan W Bailey</principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p content-type="flushleft">Social interactions between animals typically have fluid fitness outcomes, which depend on the relatedness of the interacting animals, local ecological conditions, and evolved social behaviors. These outcomes can lie anywhere on a spectrum from conflict to cooperation, and they can change within the lifetime of an individual (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This is especially evident within animal families where siblings are rivals for resources (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) yet may cooperate to obtain more food (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and where parents sometimes abandon their young yet may also care for them diligently (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). An adaptive response to such a variable social environment is for family members to employ flexible behavioral rules for social engagement, so-called negotiation strategies (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Negotiation strategies describe the set of behaviors an individual should deploy in real time to maximize fitness in response to the actions of their social partner. The adaptive response to heightened begging behavior by one offspring, for example, is for its sibling to escalate its competitive prowess by begging more (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The adaptive response to greater levels of cooperation by a sibling is to cooperate more (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In theory, negotiated social strategies within animal families change the scope for any subsequent evolutionary change in social behavior (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Negotiated strategies mean more than one genotype contributes to a focal individual&#x02019;s behavior. Consequently, the social behavior expressed by a focal individual is not only due to its own genotype (a direct genetic effect; DGE) but to the genotype of its social partner(s) (an indirect genetic effect; IGE). To see why this matters, imagine a sustained change in the social environment that tips interactions among siblings from largely competitive to largely cooperative. The resulting selection on individual larvae for increased cooperative behavior induces the expression of greater levels of cooperation among their siblings. As the trait evolves, it creates a social environment that is more likely to induce its expression, and this positive feedback cycle can induce very rapid evolution (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Negative evolutionary feedback that inhibits social evolution is also possible, if the social environment prevents trait expression (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In theory, therefore, the evolution of socially negotiated traits is strongly influenced by the strength and direction of IGEs, which can potentially tip populations into rapid evolutionary shifts, for example, from one strategy to another (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Whether this happens in practice, however, is not known. The genetic architecture of negotiated social strategies can be partitioned into DGEs and IGEs to isolate the influence of the IGEs on the evolutionary trajectories of different social types of behaviors (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), but sibling interactions have not been analyzed in this way. More generally, we are unaware of any studies showing that IGEs influence the evolution of social behavior in real time.</p><p>The environmental condition that is most likely to tip sibling interactions from conflict to cooperation is the presence or absence of parental care (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). When parents provide care, a negotiated behavioral response among siblings is to exhibit greater levels of competition for the resource that adults supply (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Conversely, when parents temporarily cease to provide care, a negotiated behavioral response is for siblings to cooperate more with each other (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). An enduring evolutionary change from facultative parental care to obligate care could correspondingly cause the evolution of increased sibling rivalry, whereas the complete cessation of facultative care could cause the evolution of greater sibling cooperation. These predictions have not been explicitly tested before. Indeed, the evolutionary relationship between the supply of parental care and interactions among siblings is poorly understood in general because each type of social interaction is more usually analyzed in isolation (e.g., ref. <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that parental care influences the evolution of sibling interactions, and that IGEs help set the pace of this evolutionary change. Our experiments focus on burying beetles <italic>Nicrophorus vespilloides</italic>, an insect that breeds on small carrion and provides highly variable levels of care for its larvae. Parents directly provision offspring with regurgitated fluids and maintain the carcass by smearing it with antimicrobial exudates. Despite the benefits of parental care for offspring survival and growth (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), parental care is continuously variable in <italic>N. vespilloides</italic>. At one extreme, one or both parents may depart before larvae hatch (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), and offspring can survive without any posthatching parental care (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). We established replicate laboratory populations, in which parents were either allowed to supply care to their offspring at each generation (<italic>n</italic> = 2 Full Care [FC] populations) or prevented from supplying any posthatching care at all (<italic>n</italic> = 2 No Care [NC] populations: see refs. <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> for further details of these populations). After 22 generations of experimental evolution, we determined whether interactions among larvae had evolved to be more competitive or more cooperative.</p><p>We analyzed larval interactions from a social evolutionary perspective (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), rather than from a purely behavioral perspective. This means that we focused on how sibling interactions influenced larval fitness, rather than deducing the specific behavioral and physiological mechanisms that might have caused the changes in fitness we measured (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). We defined a competitive sibling interaction as one in which a larva gained fitness at the expense of a rival sibling, and defined a cooperative interaction as one in which larvae caused each other to gain fitness (after ref. <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). We used larval mass at the end of development as our measure of fitness, because this is the best-known predictor of adult burying beetle survival and fecundity (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Larval development ceases approximately 5 d after hatching, when larvae crawl away from the scant remains of the carcass to pupate in the soil.</p><sec sec-type="results" id="s1"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2"><title>Larvae Evolve Greater Levels of Cooperation in Response to the Loss of Parental Care.</title><p>Burying beetle parents convert small carrion into an edible nest for their larvae by removing any fur or feathers, rolling the flesh into a ball, and burying it below ground. Larvae gather in a depression on the top of the ball, after hatching, where they feed themselves and are tended by their parents (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To evaluate whether larval interactions during development were competitive or cooperative, we established experimental broods of 10 larvae (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). The focal larvae in each treatment were an admixture of five unrelated individuals, exclusively drawn either from the NC populations or from the FC populations. The remaining five larvae were siblings, and unrelated to the focal larvae. They provided the sibling environment for each treatment, and they too were exclusively drawn either from the NC populations or from the FC populations. Thus, we had a 2 &#x000d7; 2 experimental design, enabling us to test how focal larvae that had evolved under FC or NC fared when developing alongside &#x0201c;siblings&#x0201d; that had evolved under each regime of care (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). We placed each brood on a carrion nest of standardized size that had been prepared by unrelated FC beetles to minimize any variation in larval mass that might be attributable to the carrion and left the larvae to develop without receiving any parental care. Five days later, we weighed larvae as they started to disperse away from the carcass.</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="featured" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Experimental design to identify whether the sibling environment provided by different experimentally evolving populations influences the development of focal individuals reared with them.

In contrast, we predicted a lower CV in larval mass in broods where the larvae were drawn from the same evolutionary background (i.e., FC&#x02212;FC and NC&#x02212;NC) because all larvae had evolved in the same sibling social environment, reducing the scope for temporary exploitation.

We found that, when parents supply care, selection favors the evolution of sibling rivalry. The fitness costs incurred when siblings compete with one another were fully compensated by the fitness benefits that offspring gained from parental care. Sibling rivalry was therefore only sustainable when parents cared for their young. When parents ceased to provide any care for their offspring, we found that selection instead favored cooperation among siblings. Sibling cooperation compensated for the loss of care by parents.</p><p>Previous work has suggested that parental care evolves to buffer offspring against harsh environments, potentially enabling niche expansion as a result (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). We have shown that, when parental care is lost, cooperative interactions among larvae can evolve in compensation to serve the same function and continue to buffer offspring against selection from the wider environment. Greater levels of sibling cooperation could thus enable families to persist in the same niche following the loss of parental care. In lineages that have not evolved parental care, increased cooperation among siblings could even enable niche expansion by offering greater levels of defense against predators or better access to food (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Whether it derives from interactions between parents and helpers at the nest (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), or between parents and their young, or among siblings, cooperation among conspecifics appears to be a common factor in enabling individuals to persist in relatively harsh conditions.</p><p>Sibling IGEs on mass gain were associated with evolutionary transitions between sibling rivalry and sibling cooperation. We found that <italic>&#x003c8;</italic> was large and positive when interacting siblings were drawn from the same evolutionary background. Relating this measurement back to the theory of IGEs, we infer that increasingly cooperative (or competitive) larval behavior induces greater levels of cooperation (or competition) among siblings, generating a positive feedback loop that not only speeds up the pace of evolutionary change (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) but might also induce the exponential elaboration of socially selected traits such as cooperation under a social runaway process (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Whereas runaway evolution is more commonly associated with sexual selection, our results suggest that evolutionary elaboration of sibling traits could be similarly fast-paced and have substantial fitness consequences (<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Our work further implies that the evolution of sibling interactions, in general, might be characterized by abrupt transitions between competition and cooperation, rather than more gradual change.</p><p>Our results also illustrate an important feature of the influence of IGEs on evolution: We found positive measures of <italic>&#x003c8;</italic> only when the majority of larvae in the brood were cooperative (or competitive). This means positive evolutionary feedback only occurred under these conditions. In the wild, interactions between parents and offspring may modulate the amount of care that a brood receives, which, in turn, may constrain how easily cooperation could evolve in natural populations. When we experimentally mixed broods so that they contained equal numbers of cooperative and competitive larvae, <italic>&#x003c8;</italic> was indistinguishable from zero, and the IGEs of siblings disappeared. In natural populations of burying beetles, it is likely that the supply of care fluctuates greatly from one generation to the next, maintaining a mixture of cooperative and competitive larvae and so preventing any evolutionary runaway to purely competitive or purely cooperative broods.</p><p>We are not suggesting that the loss of parental care automatically induces social runaway evolution of greater sibling cooperation. The evolutionary dynamics shown by any particular species will depend on how offspring flexibly respond to a temporary loss of care. We suggest that burying beetle larvae evolved greater levels of cooperation in response to the loss of parental care because this is their preexisting negotiated response to the temporary removal of care (see ref. <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus, the direction of adaptive evolution proceeded in the same direction as adaptive plasticity. In other species, the temporary loss of care has the opposite effect on siblings, sometimes even inducing greater levels of cannibalism among offspring (e.g., refs. <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). For these species, we predict that a sustained loss of care should induce even greater levels of competition (or cannibalism)&#x02014;because this is the direction of their preexisting negotiated response.</p><p>Although we have unequivocally found evidence of sibling cooperation, both here and in our previous work (experiment 2 in ref. <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), we cannot tell, from these experiments, exactly what form cooperative larval behavior might take. In other species, cooperation between dependent offspring can occur through offspring feeding one another or sharing food (birds: ref. <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>; insects: ref. <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) or simply reducing their selfishness (<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Direct provisioning of siblings has not been observed among burying beetle larvae. It is more likely that siblings help each other indirectly to acquire resources from the carcass, through more effective maceration of the flesh with their relatively larger mandibles (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and by coordinating their actions through greater hatching synchrony (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Larvae have also been shown to secrete fluids onto the carcass, which arrest microbial growth (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>)&#x02014;presumably to the benefit of the entire brood (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). These larval fluids might further benefit siblings if they contain digestive enzymes or growth factors (<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), although this has yet to be discovered.</p><p>In conclusion, interactions between parents and offspring can be highly cooperative when parents supply care, or more selfish when parents abandon their offspring. Likewise, siblings can show pronounced rivalry or behave more cooperatively to each other. Our study suggests that adaptive negotiation strategies establish the sign and magnitude of IGEs, and thence determine the combinations of parent and offspring social behavior that can evolve. We found that burying beetle parents can supply care, but then siblings will be rivals. Alternatively, burying beetle parents can abandon their young, and then siblings will be more cooperative.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s7"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s8"><title>The Experimental Approach.</title><p>We manipulated the sibling environment experienced by larvae and measured the effects on larval mass, a key predictor of fitness (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The mass that larvae attain by the time they disperse away from the carcass is due partly to their own foraging efforts (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and is partly due to care that they receive from their parents (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Larval foraging might involve some element of competition with siblings for limited resources, but might also involve some cooperation if, for example, maceration of the carcass facilitates sibling foraging success.</p><p>We first determined the relative balance of cooperation and competition among siblings on larval mass at dispersal, by removing parents altogether during larval development. We then compared these data to the mass attained by dispersal when larvae developed in the conditions under which they evolved (i.e., FC and NC). This comparison enabled us to determine how parents additionally contribute both to larval mass and to the variance in larval mass within each brood.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Experimental Evolution.</title><p>Four populations of <italic>N. vespilloides</italic> were subjected to experimental evolution (two populations each of FC and NC). They were founded from a genetically diverse stock population created by interbreeding four wild populations of beetles collected in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom (Byron&#x02019;s Pool, Gamlingay Woods, Overhall Grove, and Waresley Woods) in the summer of 2014, described in detail in Schrader et al. (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and Jarrett et al. (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The experimentally evolving populations were run in two blocks, to be logistically manageable. Block 1 comprised one NC population and one FC population breeding simultaneously. Block 2 comprised the second NC population and the second FC population, again breeding simultaneously. Block 2 was bred 1 wk after Block 1. For the FC populations, a minimum of 30 pairs of unrelated beetles were bred each generation. Pairs were placed in a box containing moistened soil and a small, thawed mouse carcass (8 to 14 g), and then placed in a dark cabinet for 8 d. At that point, the dispersing larvae were placed into individual cells (2 cm<sup>3</sup>), covered with moistened peat, and left undisturbed to pupate to adults. The newly eclosed adults were housed individually until breeding, a minimum of 17 d after eclosion. For the NC populations, there were two exceptions to this protocol. First, both parents were removed 53 h after pairing, allowing parents to prepare the carcass and allowing the female to lay a clutch of eggs, but ensuring no posthatching parental care occurs, because larvae usually hatch at &#x0223c;72 h after pairing (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Second, a minimum of 50 pairs of unrelated beetles were bred through the first 15 generations of experimental evolution to offset the increased number of complete brood failures (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). All individuals used in this experiment were from generation 23 (i.e., after 22 generations of experimental evolution).</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Split-Brood Experimental Design.</title><p>The experiment followed a 2 &#x000d7; 2 blocked design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). We performed the experiment in two blocks, corresponding to Block 1 and Block 2 of the experimentally evolving populations. The following four treatments were used: FC focal larvae in an FC sibling environment; FC focal larvae in an NC sibling environment; NC focal larvae in an FC sibling environment; and NC focal larvae in an NC sibling environment. To generate the four treatments, we bred 50 pairs of unrelated individuals from each population, giving each pair a 10- to 11-g mouse carcass under standard conditions (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Parents and carcass were removed 53 h after pairing. When larvae hatched, we selected 10 broods whose larvae generated the sibling environment (<italic>n</italic> = 5 larvae per experimental brood). The remaining families of larvae were used to create an admixture of five unrelated FC or NC focal larvae. In this admixed social group, we only used one larva per family to create a genetically diverse pool of focal larvae, and we ensured that none of these larvae were related to the respective treatment family. Thus, each experimental brood comprised 10 larvae, the density on the carcass at which larvae attain peak mass in the absence of parental care (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). We chose this density for our experimental manipulations to increase the likelihood that we would detect an effect of sibling cooperation (or competition) on larval mass. FC and NC populations have experienced highly variable larval densities across the generations since the experiment began (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Brood size is too inconsistent between the generations and too similar between FC and NC populations for it to have been a consistent source of selection. It is therefore highly unlikely that standardizing brood size introduced any potential confounding effects into our experimental design.</p><p>Newly hatched larvae were lightly anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub>, and either the left or right hind tarsus was cut off so that we could identify the focal larvae and interacting family larvae within each brood. This marking technique did not affect mortality, larval growth, or development (paired <italic>t</italic> tests, all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.20), consistent with a previous study that employed this technique (<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Larvae were then placed on a similarly sized carcass (mass = 9.52 &#x000b1; 0.27 g [mean &#x000b1; SD]; range = 9.00 to 10.00 g) prepared by unrelated FC parents. From a pool of prepared carcasses, we only used those that were fully prepared but lacked any incision into the carcass. We then cut a small entry hole (1 cm) into the thigh of each prepared carcass, so that all larvae had equal access to these vital resources (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The experimental broods on their nest were then placed in a small plastic box lined with compost, which was put in a dark cabinet, without parents, until larvae completed development and were dispersing away from the carcass. At this point, 5 d after setting up the broods, we noted the identity of each larva and weighed each one to the nearest 0.1 mg. Note that this means larval mass was measured at the same developmental stage for all larvae. By standardizing carcass quality, carcass size, developmental stage, and brood size experimentally, we could attribute any differences in larval mass to interactions among siblings alone.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>Variance Partitioning to Detect IGEs.</title><p>Applying a variance partitioning approach, we tested the influence of the evolutionary history of admixed focal larvae plus the influence of their social environment (i.e., the genetic background of the interacting sibling individuals within it) on mass, following previous methods (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The following statistical analyses were performed in R 3.4.1 (<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) using the package lme4 (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Models were fit using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) method, and significance testing of random effects was done using ML. To partition variance in larval mass, we used a linear mixed model with the larval mass attained by unrelated focal individuals at dispersal as the dependent variable. The model included the following terms: &#x0201c;focal,&#x0201d; indicating experimental evolution population identity of the admixed focal larvae on the carcass (FC vs. NC); &#x0201c;sibling,&#x0201d; indicating experimental evolution population identity of the full-sib larvae on the carcass (FC vs. NC), and a &#x0201c;sibling &#x000d7; focal&#x0201d; interaction term, and &#x0201c;block,&#x0201d; representing the replicated independently evolving FC and NC populations. We also included &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; nested within &#x0201c;sibling&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;replicate&#x0201d; nested within &#x0201c;family-within-sibling&#x0201d; as random effects. We only retained a treatment family if there were at least two full-sib larvae and two unrelated focal larvae that survived to dispersal on each of the four carcasses. Of the 19 FC and NC treatment families set up, we retained 13 and 15 families, respectively.</p><p>IGEs involving a specific trait such as body mass are not expected a priori to be uniform in different evolutionary contexts (<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Because we also manipulated the evolved background of focal individuals, it is possible that NC focal larvae would experience different IGEs than FC focal larvae (i.e., G &#x000d7; G IGE; ref. <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The two-way interaction term between focal and interacting sibling background in this analysis tested specifically for this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Trait-Based IGE Estimates.</title><p>We evaluated IGEs on larval mass, disaggregating our estimates of <italic>&#x003c8;</italic> for each of the four possible treatment combinations of focal and interacting sibling individuals: NC&#x02212;NC, NC&#x02212;FC, FC&#x02212;NC, and FC&#x02212;FC. A trait-based analysis was used to identify and characterize reciprocal IGEs occurring within these different social environments. Focal trait values were calculated as an average across focal individuals in each brood, so each observation involved focal individuals exposed to a social environment comprising four other individuals from the same background, plus five sibling individuals which were experimentally manipulated to either match or mismatch the focal background (NC or FC). It is possible that exposure of focals to a greater proportion of sibling individuals from opposing environments in the mismatched condition could have stronger effects, so our estimates of social environment effects are therefore likely to be conservative. We made four estimates corresponding to the combinations of evolved populations: <inline-formula><mml:math id="i4"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>&#x003c8;</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">NC</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">NC</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="i5"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>&#x003c8;</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">NC</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">FC</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="i6"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>&#x003c8;</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">FC</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">NC</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="i7"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>&#x003c8;</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">FC</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">FC</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, where terms before and after the hyphen in superscript indicate the evolutionary background of the focal and sibling larvae, respectively.

The interaction was significant, so we performed post hoc Tukey tests to assess the significance of differences in CVs between each pair of treatment groups. These revealed a pattern consistent with our predictions: When the evolved backgrounds of focals and larvae were different, we found high CVs for larval mass [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>, and see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1911677117/-/DCSupplemental" xlink:show="new"><italic>SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S2</ext-link> for CVs separated by block]).</p><p>We then used the data collected on generation 23 of the experimentally evolved populations to determine whether parental care compensated for the costs of sibling rivalry. We did not control brood size as in the previous experiments, but rather let parents determine brood size. Therefore, broods were larger than those in our experimental manipulations, and yielded correspondingly smaller larvae at dispersal, due to the well-documented trade-off in <italic>N. vespilloides</italic> between larval density and larval mass (see ref. <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
