A series of experiments were conducted on an electric heating and testing apparatus. The experimental results indicate that 6 W is the critical heating power for 40% SOC. With a 20 W constant heating rate, the thermal runaway initial temperature of the lithium-ion battery decreases with the increasing SOC. The final thermal runaway temperature increases with the SOC when the SOC is lower than 80%. However, a contrary conclusion was obtained when the SOC was higher than 80%. Significant mass loss, accompanied by an intense exothermic reaction, took place under a higher SOC. The critical charging current, beyond which the thermal runaway occurs, was found to be 2.6 A. The thermal runaway initial temperature decreases with the increasing charging current, while the intensity of the exothermic reaction varies inversely. Mass ejection of gas and electrolytes exists during thermal runaway when the charging current is higher than 10.4 A, below which only a large amount of gas is released. The thermal runaway initial temperature of discharging is higher than that of non-discharging.">

A number of powders ranging from metals to electrically insulative ceramics have been successfully densified resulting in homogeneous microstructures within sintering times of 8-35 s. A finite element simulation reveals that the developed method, providing an extraordinary fast and homogeneous heating concentrated in the sample's volume and punches, is applicable to all the different samples tested. The utilized uniquely controllable flash phenomenon is enabled by the combination of the electric current concentration around the sample and the confinement of the heat generated in this area by the lateral thermal contact resistance. The presented new method allows: extending flash sintering to nearly all materials, controlling sample shape by an added graphite die, and an energy efficient mass production of small and intermediate size objects. This approach represents also a potential venue for future investigations of flash sintering of complex shapes.">

Currently used models relating the maximum magnitude of injection-induced earthquakes to injection parameters do not incorporate rupture physics. We develop theoretical estimates, validated by simulations, of the size of ruptures induced by localized pore-pressure perturbations and propagating on prestressed faults. Our model accounts for ruptures growing beyond the perturbed area and distinguishes self-arrested from runaway ruptures. We develop a theoretical scaling relation between the largest magnitude of self-arrested earthquakes and the injected volume and find it consistent with observed maximum magnitudes of injection-induced earthquakes over a broad range of injected volumes, suggesting that, although runaway ruptures are possible, most injection-induced events so far have been self-arrested ruptures.">

The traditional track skates for anti-runaway prevention of rolling stocks have some disadvantages since they are operated and monitored completely manually. This paper describes an anti-runaway prevention system (ARPS) based on intelligent track skates equipped with sensors and real-time monitoring and management system. This system, which has been updated from the traditional track skates, comprises four parts: intelligent track skates, a signal reader, a database station, and a monitoring system. This system can monitor the real-time situation of track skates without changing their workflow for anti-runaway prevention, and thus realize the integration of anti-runaway prevention information management. This system was successfully tested and practiced at Sunjia station in Harbin Railway Bureau in 2014, and the results confirmed that the system showed 100% accuracy in reflecting the usage status of the track skates. The system could meet practical demands, as it is highly reliable and supports long-distance communication.">

If the high rate of gas generation during thermal runaway is not adequately vented, commercial cell designs can rupture and explode, presenting serious safety concerns. Here, ultra-high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging is used at &gt;20 000 frames per second to characterize the venting processes of six different 18650 cell designs undergoing thermal runaway. For the first time, the mechanisms that lead to the most catastrophic type of cell failure, rupture, and explosion are identified and elucidated in detail. The practical application of the technique is highlighted by evaluating a novel 18650 cell design with a second vent at the base, which is shown to avoid the critical stages that lead to rupture. The insights yielded in this study shed new light on battery failure and are expected to guide the development of safer commercial cell designs.">

The differences between the obese and normal weight children were researched. Finally, Jeju was compared with Seoul, which has the lowest obesity prevalence in school age children. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi square test of PASW Statistics ver. 18.0.Compared to the normal weight group, the obese group had significantly higher rates of consuming soft drinks (p&lt;0.001), fast food intake (p=0.019), skipping breakfast (p&lt;0.001), insufficient sleep (p&lt;0.001), bullying experiences (p=0.001) and runaway impulses (p=0.012). Compared to Seoul, Jeju Island had significantly higher rates of Ramen intake (3.4% vs. 5.4%, p=0.021) and meat intake (46.0% vs. 52.9%, p=0.003). On the other hand, Jeju Island was significantly lower than was Seoul in their fruit intake (83.4% vs. 67.1%, p&lt;0.001), vegetable intake (71.4% vs. 64.2%, p=0.001), and intense physical activity (63.4% vs. 47.7%, p&lt;0.001). Meanwhile, insufficient sleep (15.4% vs. 9.6%, p&lt;0.001) and runaway impulses (5.6% vs. 3.3%, p=0.027) in children were significantly lower in Jeju Island than in Seoul.The results of the obesity factor analysis of elementary school students in Jeju Island can be used as useful educational material for lowering the obesity prevalence in Jeju community.">

From the clearing of vegetation using fire to the emergence of agriculture and beyond, human societies have increasingly sustained themselves through practices that enhance environmental productivity through ecosystem engineering. At the same time, human societies have increased in scale and complexity from mobile bands of hunter-gatherers to telecoupled world systems. We propose that these long-term changes are coupled through positive feedbacks among social and environmental changes, coevolved primarily through selection acting at the group level and above, and that this can be tested by combining archeological evidence with mechanistic experiments using an agent-based virtual laboratory (ABVL) approach. A more robust understanding of whether and how cultural multi-level selection couples human social change with environmental transformation may help in addressing the long-term sustainability challenges of the Anthropocene.">

        <span class="abst" title="Solid state memory and switching devices aimed at replacing the flash memory technology operate by switching from the high to low resistance when conductive filaments are created in response to the electric pulse. The filaments are identified with either structurally different protrusions or purely electronic conductive pathways. The former can appear via the field induced nucleation (FIN), while the latter do not require phase transformations and are attributed to certain types of temperature and bias dependent conductivity. The existing understanding of those processes ignores features related to extremely small linear sizes of nano-structures. Such are, for example, the device sizes smaller than critical nucleation radii, and/or the electron energy relaxation lengths exceeding the structure dimensions. This paper develops a theory of switching under nano-size conditions. We show how the structure thinness can make FIN a truly threshold phenomenon possible only for voltage (not the field) exceeding a certain critical value. We predict the possibility of threshold switching without memory for certain thickness dependent voltages. The thermal runaway mechanism of electronic switching is described analytically leading to results consistent with the published numerical modeling. Our predictions offer possible experimental verifications deciding between FIN and thermal runaway switching.">

The early emergence of filaments in evolutionary history suggests that filament genesis might be a robust process. Here we describe the fortuitous construction of GFP fusion proteins that self-assemble as fluorescent polar filaments in Escherichia coli. Filament formation is achieved by appending as few as 12 residues to GFP. Crystal structures reveal that each protomer donates an appendage to fill a groove between the two following protomers along the filament. This exchange of appendages resembles runaway domain swapping but is distinguished by higher efficiency because monomers cannot competitively bind their own appendages. Ample evidence for this 'runaway domain coupling' mechanism in nature suggests it could facilitate the evolutionary pathway from globular protein to polar filament, requiring a minimal extension of protein sequence and no substantial refolding.">

In the absence of periodic structure, these materials typically deform in highly localized, thin shear bands at ambient and low temperatures. This process usually leads to an abrupt fracture, hindering their wider use in structural applications. The dynamics and temperature effects on the formation and operation of those shear bands have been the focus of long-standing debate. Here, we use a new experimental approach based on localized boiling of liquid nitrogen by the heat generated in the shear bands to monitor the tensile plastic deformation of a bulk metallic glass submerged in a cryogenic bath. With the &quot;nitrogen bubbles heat sensor&quot;, we could capture the heat dissipation along the primary shear banding plane and follow the dynamics of the shear band operation. The observation of nitrogen boiling on the surface of the deforming metallic glass gives direct evidence of temperature increase in the shear bands, even at cryogenic temperatures. An acceleration in bubble nucleation towards the end of the apparent plastic deformation suggests a change from steady-state to runaway shear and premonitions the fracture, allowing us to resolve the sequence of deformation and failure events.">

        <span class="abst" title="The formation and stability of social hierarchies is a question of general relevance. Here, we propose a simple generalized theoretical model for establishing social hierarchy via pair-wise interactions between individuals and investigate its stability. In each interaction or fight, the probability of &quot;winning&quot; depends solely on the relative societal status of the participants, and the winner has a gain of status whereas there is an equal loss to the loser. The interactions are characterized by two parameters. The first parameter represents how much can be lost, and the second parameter represents the degree to which even a small difference of status can guarantee a win for the higher-status individual. Depending on the parameters, the resulting status distributions reach either a continuous unimodal form or lead to a totalitarian end state with one high-status individual and all other individuals having status approaching zero. However, we find that in the latter case long-lived intermediary distributions often exist, which can give the illusion of a stable society. As we show, our model allows us to make predictions consistent with animal interaction data and their evolution over a number of years. Moreover, by implementing a simple, but realistic rule that restricts interactions to sufficiently similar-status individuals, the stable or long-lived distributions acquire high-status structure corresponding to a distinct high-status class. Using household income as a proxy for societal status in human societies, we find agreement over their entire range from the low-to-middle-status parts to the characteristic high-status &quot;tail&quot;. We discuss how the model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the origin of social hierarchy and the factors which lead to the preservation or deterioration of the societal structure.">

Here we report strong departure from this expectation for common, homogeneous ionic solids such as alkali silicate glasses when subjected even to moderate fields (~100 V/cm). Unlike electronically conducting metals and semiconductors, with time the heating of ionically conducting glass becomes extremely inhomogeneous with the formation of a nanoscale alkali-depletion region, such that the glass melts near the anode, even evaporates, while remaining solid elsewhere. In situ infrared imaging shows and finite element analysis confirms localized temperatures more than thousand degrees above the remaining sample depending on whether the field is DC or AC. These observations unravel the origin of recently discovered electric field induced softening of glass. The observed highly inhomogeneous temperature profile point to the challenges for the application of Joule's law to the electrical performance of glassy thin films, nanoscale devices, and similarly-scaled phenomena.">

A 75-year-old man was admitted with 3 days history of fluttering in the chest, shortness of breath, central chest and epigastric pain which radiated to the back. His medical history includes pacemaker implantation in 1996 with lead complication following which he was managed with VVI pacemaker, and the last procedure was generator change 4 years ago with no complication. Examination revealed ventricular tachycardia with ECG showing paced rhythm with ventricular pacing at the rate of 200-150/min. His pacemaker-induced ventricular tachycardia was immediately aborted after putting magnet on the device which restored his baseline rhythm with heart rate of 60/min.

Understanding how localized high temperatures affect the battery is critical but remains challenging, mainly due to the difficulty of probing battery internal temperature with high spatial resolution. Here we introduce a method to induce and sense localized high temperature inside a lithium battery using micro-Raman spectroscopy. We discover that temperature hotspots can induce significant lithium metal growth as compared to the surrounding lower temperature area due to the locally enhanced surface exchange current density. More importantly, localized high temperature can be one of the factors to cause battery internal shorting, which further elevates the temperature and increases the risk of thermal runaway. This work provides important insights on the effects of heterogeneous temperatures within batteries and aids the development of safer batteries, thermal management schemes, and diagnostic tools.">

However, more primitive forms of photosynthesis that fix CO2 into biomass using electrons from reduced species like Fe(II) and H2 instead of water would have competed with Earth's early oxygenic biosphere for essential nutrients. Here, we combine experimental microbiology, genomic analyses, and Earth system modeling to demonstrate that competition for light and nutrients in the surface ocean between oxygenic phototrophs and Fe(II)-oxidizing, anoxygenic photosynthesizers (photoferrotrophs) translates into diminished global photosynthetic O2 release when the ocean interior is Fe(II)-rich. These results provide a simple ecophysiological mechanism for inhibiting atmospheric oxygenation during Earth's early history. We also find a novel positive feedback within the coupled C-P-O-Fe cycles that can lead to runaway planetary oxygenation as rising atmospheric pO2 sweeps the deep ocean of the ferrous iron substrate for photoferrotrophy.">

        <span class="abst" title="High-temperature superconductors (HTS) could enable high-field magnets stronger than is possible with Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn, but two challenges have so far been the low engineering critical current density JE, especially in high-current cables, and the danger of quenches. Most HTS magnets made so far have been made out of REBCO coated conductor. Here we demonstrate stable, reliable and training-quench-free performance of Bi-2212 racetrack coils wound with a Rutherford cable fabricated from wires made with a new precursor powder. These round multifilamentary wires exhibited a record JE up to 950 A/mm2 at 30 T at 4.2 K. These coils carried up to 8.6 kA while generating 3.5 T at 4.2 K at a JE of 1020 A/mm2. Different from the unpredictable training performance of Nb-Ti and Nb3Sn magnets, these Bi-2212 magnets showed no training quenches and entered the flux flow state in a stable manner before thermal runaway and quench occurred. Also different from Nb-Ti, Nb3Sn, and REBCO magnets for which localized thermal runaways occur at unpredictable locations, the quenches of Bi-2212 magnets consistently occurred in the high field regions over a long conductor length. These characteristics make quench detection simple, enabling safe protection, and suggest a new paradigm of constructing quench-predictable superconducting magnets from Bi-2212.">

To minimalize the risk, the reaction is commonly performed in a solvent as empirical industrial practice. In this work, the thermal runaway hazards of the ethylbenzene-styrene system with different monomer mass fractions were calorimetrically investigated up to temperatures where decomposition products are unlikely to be produced. Experiments showed that the polymerization runaway &quot;onset&quot; temperature inversely increased with the monomer mass fraction. Experiment and thermodynamic calculations showed that volatile diluent increased system vapor pressure even at a lower adiabatic temperature rise and verified that moderation of the risks could be achieved if the monomer mass fraction is below ca. 85%. A lumped kinetic model developed by Hui and Hamielec was used to predict the runaway profile of this reaction under different dilutions, and the agreement was excellent.">

Once restored to isosmotic environment, the reversed cells would either continue to divide or instead to form binuclear cells that further proliferated in runaway fashions. The immunofluorescent staining of tubulins and myosin II indicated that the hypotonic stress affected the accumulation of tubulins and myosin II at the contractile ring. Distinct from previous studies using specific chemical reagents, the present study provides a simple method to manipulate cell division. The morphological reversal is the adaption of dividing cells to the environmental change. The observation opens a new window to understand cell division mechanisms and runaways.">

The experiments are conducted by irradiating a basalt stone (~30-cm3 volume, either naturally shaped or cut to a cubic brick) in a microwave cavity, fed by an adaptively-matched magnetron (~1 kW at 2.45 GHz). Effects of LMH and thermal-runaway instability in basalt are observed and compared to theory. Various in- and ex-situ diagnostics are used in order to characterize the dusty-plasma observed and its nanoparticle products. The resemblance of the experimental phenomena obtained in small laboratory scale to gigantic volcanic phenomena in nature is noticed, and its potential relevance to further volcanic studies is discussed. In particular, we show that LMH could be instrumental for laboratory demonstrations and simulations of miniature-volcano effects, such as lava flows, formation of volcanic glass (obsidian), eruption of dusty-plasma and volcanic ash, and ejection of ball lightning. These findings might be significant as well for various applications, such as drilling and mining, microwave-induced breakdown spectroscopy (MIBS), mineral extraction, and powder production directly from basalts.">

Here, we present a customized LIB setup developed for early detection of electrode temperature rise during simulated thermal runaway tests incorporating a modern additive manufacturing-supported resistance temperature detector (RTD). An advanced RTD is embedded in a 3D printed polymeric substrate and placed behind the electrode current collector of CR2032 coin cells that can sustain harsh electrochemical operational environments (acidic electrolyte without Redox, short-circuiting, leakage etc.) without participating in electrochemical reactions. The internal RTD measured an average 5.8 °C higher temperature inside the cells than the external RTD with almost 10 times faster detection ability, prohibiting thermal runaway events without interfering in the LIBs' operation. A temperature prediction model is developed to forecast battery surface temperature rise stemming from measured internal and external RTD temperature signatures.">

        <span class="abst" title="Electronic cigarettes, also known as e-cigarettes (E-cig), are lithium-battery-powered devices, which became available for sale in the United States in 2017. It has gained significant popularity among younger-generation tobacco smokers due to its advertisement as a non-toxic inhalation property and a potential smoking-cessation aid. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been regulating e-cigarettes as tobacco products and not as drug-delivery devices, as many medical experts think it should be categorized. In the last few years, the medical community has encountered increasing episodes of burn injuries secondary to e-cigarette battery explosion. Explosions occur through a process known as a &quot;thermal runaway.&quot; This process occurs when the battery overheats and the internal battery temperature increases dangerously high, to the point of inner fire and explosion. Overcharge, puncture, external heat, short circuit, amongst others, are conditions that cause a &quot;thermal runaway.&quot; This is a retrospective review and analysis of six patients with superficial, partial, and full-thickness burn injuries related to e-cigarette battery explosions managed at Johns Hopkins Bayview Burn Center over the course of one year. Lund-Browder diagrams and calculations were used to assess the total body surface area (TBSA) burns. Laser Doppler imaging (LDI) was used to evaluate the indeterminate depth of the burn. Only one of our six patients required tangential excision and skin grafting. The rest of our patients were treated conservatively with complex wound care, which included the mixed combination of topical collagenase and bacitracin, collagenase and mafenide, or silver sulfadiazine as a single-agent treatment with an excellent response. Five patients were discharged home within a week, including the patient who required operative excision and auto-grafting. One patient stayed for eight days for pain control and complex wound care. Our experience with these burns has been similar to what is previously reported. Most of these burns are managed with complex wound care without any surgical interventions. The e-cigarette batteries seem more prone to failure due to an inherent weakness in their structural design. This makes them particularly susceptible to the &quot;thermal runaway.&quot; Therefore, we recognized the need to expand the regulation and control of the quality of these devices. Prevention of these burns will require continuing education for the community on the use of E-cig. products and its potential hazardous implications. New efforts should be made to educate the community and healthcare providers regarding the potential hazardous implication of carrying these batteries. Also, there is insufficient data to support or deny the long-term health effects of using e-cigarettes.">

Syndromes of deficient pain document tragically the utility of pain to motivate escape from and avoidance of situations causing tissue damage. Much apparently excessive pain is actually normal because the cost of more pain is often vastly less than the cost of too little pain (the smoke detector principle). Vulnerability to pathological pain may be explained in part because natural selection has shaped mechanisms that respond adaptively to repeated tissue damage by decreasing the pain threshold and increasing pain salience. The other half of an evolutionary approach describes the phylogeny of pain mechanisms; the apparent independence of different kinds of pain is of special interest. Painful mental states such as anxiety, guilt and low mood may have evolved from physical pain precursors. Preliminary evidence for this is found in anatomic and genetic data. Such insights from evolutionary medicine may help in understanding vulnerability to chronic pain.

Therefore, this study is aimed at investigating the effect of the microwaving on the properties of coal bottom ash(CBA) geopolymers. We prepared geopolymer samples by casting a mixture of ground CBA and 14 M NaOH solution against cubic molds with a hand press machine, followed by pre-curing in a dry oven at 75 °C for 24 h and microwaving under various powers and durations. The compressive strength strongly depended on the moisture content, i.e., the strength increased from 21 to 65 MPa or higher as the moisture content decreased to critical values, after which the strength began to decrease. The results showed that microwave energy stimulated an additional geopolymerization by evaporating the redundant free water. This led to the strength gain, although the over-irradiation generated a high internal stress and poor structural integrity, which resulted in the strength loss. Therefore, the appropriate application of microwave energy is a promising option for synthesizing high-strength geopolymers in a cost- and time-effective manner.">

Here, the NMEA 2000 network sensor devices for the measurement and supervision of the parameters inherent to energy storage and energy supply are reviewed. The importance of energy storage systems in ships, the causes and models of battery aging, types of failures, and predictive diagnosis techniques for valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries used for assisted and safe navigation are discussed. In ships, battery banks are installed in chambers that normally do not have temperature regulation and therefore are significantly conditioned by the outside temperature. A specific method based on the analysis of the time-series data of random and seasonal factors is proposed for the comparative trend analyses of both the battery internal temperature and the battery installation chamber temperature. The objective is to apply predictive fault diagnosis to detect any undesirable increase in battery temperature using prior indicators of heat dissipation process failure-to avoid the development of the most frequent and dangerous failure modes of VRLA batteries such as dry out and thermal runaway. It is concluded that these failure modes can be conveniently diagnosed by easily recognized patterns, obtained by performing comparative trend analyses to the variables measured onboard by NMEA sensors.">

Historically, some of these migrants escaped from the Brazilian gold mines and farms to which they had been brought and settled in remote valleys and this was the main mode of resistance to the slavery system. These runaway-slave descendant communities are called quilombos, a group with distinct ethnic identity, specific behavioral habits, including geographic isolation and conservative practices. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of rodent-borne viruses in two Afro-descendent communities from Mato Grosso do Sul State, Midwestern Brazil. A total of 319 individuals from rural and urban quilombola communities were enrolled. Twelve (3.76%) had anti-rodent-borne virus IgG antibodies. Seven (2.19%) were anti-mammarenavirus reactive and nine (2.82%) had anti-orthohantavirus antibodies. The literature includes limited data on the health status of quilombola communities, but all the studies emphasize the disparity of attention of local healthcare personnel to these communities compared to the general population. The findings of this study highlight the vulnerability and the precarious health conditions of quilombola groups, especially those living in rural areas and thus, point to the need of preventive measures to improve access to healthcare for this ethnic group.">

Previous theoretical work has shown mate choice can evolve to prevent runaway STI virulence evolution in chronic, sterilizing infections. Here, I generalize this theory to examine how a broader range of life-history traits influence coevolution; specifically, how host preferences for healthy mates and STI virulence coevolve when infections are acute and can cause mortality or sterility, and hosts do not form long-term sexual partnerships. I show that mate choice reduces both mortality and sterility virulence, with qualitatively different outcomes depending on the mode of virulence, costs associated with mate choice, recovery rates, and host lifespan. For example, fluctuating selection-a key finding in previous work-is most likely when hosts have moderate lifespans, STIs cause sterility and long infections, and costs of mate choice are low. The results reveal new insights into the coevolution of mate choice and STI virulence as different life-history traits vary, providing increased support for parasite-mediated sexual selection as a potential driver of host mate choice, and mate choice as a constraint on the evolution of virulence.">

Internal short circuit is a very critical issue that is often ascribed to be a cause of many accidents involving Li-ion batteries. A novel method that can detect the Internal short circuit in real time based on an advanced machine leaning approach, is proposed. Based on an equivalent electric circuit model, a set of features encompassing the physics of Li-ion cell with short circuit fault are identified and extracted from each charge-discharge cycle. The training feature set is generated with and without an external short-circuit resistance across the battery terminals. To emulate a real user scenario, internal short is induced by mechanical abuse. The testing feature set is generated from the battery charge-discharge data before and after the abuse. A random forest classifier is trained with the training feature set. The fault detection accuracy for the testing dataset is found to be more than 97%. The proposed algorithm does not interfere with the normal usage of the device, and the trained model can be implemented in any device for online fault detection.">

Results showed that the addition of h-BN not only enhanced the thermal stability of Co3O4/RGO nanocomposites but also enhanced the specific surface area.

        <span class="abst" title="The most widely cited explanation for the evolution of reliable signals is Zahavi's so-called Handicap Principle, which proposes that signals are honest because they are costly to produce. Here we provide a critical review of the Handicap Principle and its theoretical development. We explain why this idea is erroneous, and how it nevertheless became widely accepted as the leading explanation for honest signalling. In 1975, Zahavi proposed that elaborate secondary sexual characters impose 'handicaps' on male survival, not due to inadvertent signalling trade-offs, but as a mechanism that functions to demonstrate males' genetic quality to potential mates. His handicap hypothesis received many criticisms, and in response, Zahavi clarified his hypothesis and explained that it assumes that signals are wasteful as well as costly, and that they evolve because wastefulness enforces honesty. He proposed that signals evolve under 'signal selection', a non-Darwinian type of selection that favours waste rather than efficiency. He maintained that the handicap hypothesis provides a general principle to explain the evolution of all types of signalling systems, i.e. the Handicap Principle. In 1977, Zahavi proposed a second hypothesis for honest signalling, which received many different labels and interpretations, although it was assumed to be another example of handicap signalling. In 1990, Grafen published models that he claimed vindicated Zahavi's Handicap Principle. His conclusions were widely accepted and the Handicap Principle subsequently became the dominant paradigm for explaining the evolution of honest signalling in the biological and social sciences. Researchers have subsequently focused on testing predications of the Handicap Principle, such as measuring the absolute costs of honest signals (and using energetic and other proximate costs as proxies for fitness), but very few have attempted to test Grafen's models. We show that Grafen's models do not support the handicap hypothesis, although they do support Zahavi's second hypothesis, which proposes that males adjust their investment into the expression of their sexual signals according to their condition and ability to bear the costs (and risks to their survival). Rather than being wasteful over-investments, honest signals evolve in this scenario because selection favours efficient and optimal investment into signal expression and minimizes signalling costs. This idea is very different from the handicap hypothesis, but it has been widely misinterpreted and equated to the Handicap Principle. Theoretical studies have since shown that signalling costs paid at the equilibrium are neither sufficient nor necessary to maintain signal honesty, and that honesty can evolve through differential benefits, as well as differential costs. There have been increasing criticisms of the Handicap Principle, but they have focused on the limitations of Grafen's model and overlooked the fact that it is not a handicap model. This model is better understood within a Darwinian framework of adaptive signalling trade-offs, without the added burden and confusing logic of the Handicap Principle. There is no theoretical or empirical support for the Handicap Principle and the time is long overdue to usher this idea into an 'honorable retirement'.">

        <span class="abst" title="Sibling rivalry is commonplace within animal families, yet offspring can also work together to promote each other's fitness. Here we show that the extent of parental care can determine whether siblings evolve to compete or to cooperate. Our experiments focus on the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, which naturally provides variable levels of care to its larvae. We evolved replicate populations of burying beetles under two different regimes of parental care: Some populations were allowed to supply posthatching care to their young (Full Care), while others were not (No Care). After 22 generations of experimental evolution, we found that No Care larvae had evolved to be more cooperative, whereas Full Care larvae were more competitive. Greater levels of cooperation among larvae compensated for the fitness costs caused by parental absence, whereas parental care fully compensated for the fitness costs of sibling rivalry. We dissected the evolutionary mechanisms underlying these responses by measuring indirect genetic effects (IGEs) that occur when different sibling social environments induce the expression of more cooperative (or more competitive) behavior in focal larvae. We found that indirect genetic effects create a tipping point in the evolution of larval social behavior. Once the majority of offspring in a brood start to express cooperative (or competitive) behavior, they induce greater levels of cooperation (or competition) in their siblings. The resulting positive feedback loops rapidly lock larvae into evolving greater levels of cooperation in the absence of parental care and greater levels of rivalry when parents provide care.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Car accidents due to unexpected forward or backward runaway by older drivers are a serious social problem. Although the cause of these accidents is often attributed to stepping on the accelerator instead of the brake, it is difficult to induce such pedal application errors systematically with usual drive simulators. We developed a simple personal computer system that induces the pedal errors, and investigate the effects of age on the error behaviors. METHODS:The system consisted of a laptop computer and a three-pedal foot mouse. It measured response time, accuracy, and flexibility of pedal operation to visual stimuli. The system displayed two open circles on the computer display, lighting one of the circles in a random order and interval. Subjects were instructed to press the foot pedal with their right foot as quickly as possible when the circle was lit; the ipsilateral pedal to the lit circle in a parallel mode and the contralateral pedal in a cross mode. When the correct pedal was pressed, the light went off immediately, but when the wrong pedal was pressed, the buzzer sounded and the light remained on until the correct pedal was pressed. During a 6-min trial, the mode was switched between parallel and cross every 2 min. During the cross mode, a cross mark appears on the display. The pedal responses were evaluated in 52 subjects divided into young (20-29 years), middle-aged (30-64 years), and older (65-84 years) groups. Additionally, the repeatability of the pedal response characteristic indicators was examined in 14 subjects who performed this test twice. RESULTS:The mean response time was 95 ms (17%) longer in the older group than in the young group. More characteristically, however, the older group showed 2.1 times more frequent pedal errors, fell into long hesitations (response freezing &gt; 3 s) 16 times more often, and took 1.8 times longer period to correct the wrong pedal than the young groups. The indicators of pedal response characteristics showed within-individual repeatability to the extent that can identify the age-dependent changes. CONCLUSIONS:Hesitations and extended error correction time can be associated with increased crash risk due to unexpected runaway by older drivers. The system we have developed may help to uncover and evaluate physiological characteristics related to crash risk in the elderly population.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Sexually exploited youth are disconnected from societal tethers and need support systems, which makes them some of the most vulnerable of youth. This heightened level of vulnerability increases their risk for violence, abuse, ongoing sexual exploitation and all its sequelae. The purpose of this study was to examine an evidence-based intervention called STRIVE (support to reunite, involve and value each other) that has been a successful family re-engagement strategy with newly homeless youth. We sought to explore its contextual relevance for youth with risk factors for sexual exploitation and identify necessary adaptations to reduce risk factors for sexual exploitation. We deliberately took an intersectional approach in conducting this study. Methods:Six community-based focus groups were conducted with youth at risk for sexual exploitation and their service providers. Each group was recorded, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. Results:Results from 29 youth and 11 providers indicate that there are unique considerations that must be taken into account while working with youth at risk for sexual exploitation to ensure effective service delivery and/or ethical research. Emergent themes included: setting the stage by building rapport and acknowledging experiences of structural violence, protect and hold which balances youth's need for advocacy/support with their caregivers' need for validation/understanding, and walking the safety tightrope by assessing risks and safety planning. Discussion:Focus groups are an effective methodology when working with traditionally disempowered populations particularly in gaining a range of perspectives to meet unique needs/preferences. Youth at risk for commercial sexual exploitation needs require strengths-based, individualized, multi-systemic approaches.">

The presented computational results suggest that both carbonate and sulfate anions can intercept an acid proton from nitric acid issued from the first step of decomposition of AN, thus inhibiting its runaway decomposition and the generation of reactive species (radicals). The reaction then leads to the production of stable products, as experimentally observed. Our modeling outcomes allow for tracing a relationship between the capability of proton acceptance of both carbonate and sulfate anions and the macroscopic behavior of these two additives as inhibitor or inert in the AN mixture.">

A ridge waveguide with a TE10 mode was used in which the sample was heated and measured simultaneously at a frequency of 2450 MHz, and the microwave interferometer is used to collect the amplitude and phase difference of the incident signal. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm trained by the corresponding simulation data is used to construct the inversion model to calculate the complex dielectric coefficient of the tested material. Besides, this paper uses linear regression algorithm (LR) to calibrate the measurement system in order to improve the measurement accuracy. The entire system was tested using different materials at room temperature, and the maximum error of the measurement accuracy is less than 8% compared to the theoretical data. The robustness of the entire system was also tested by measuring Macor materials up to 800 °C. This proposed method provides an effective way to understand the mechanism between microwaves and matter at high temperatures.">

        <span class="abst" title="Is bioprocess dangerous? How to maintain safety? What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical or biotransformation means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, while changes can also be harmful. The first-line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four-risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system (GHS) of classification and labeling is generally agreed by the world bodies. The hazards are divided into three categories—physical, health, and environmental hazards. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safe guard processes and facility, one needs to first identify the threat, or screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high-activation energy, combustion leads to large-temperature dependence. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) The accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) Leakage of “significant amount” of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to atmosphere or environment; or (3) Reactor runaway. As a bioprocess engineer, you will be responsible for creating safe processes and protecting the lives and health of your colleagues.">

These and other questions pervade major future developments within synthetic biology. The goal of engineering ecosystems is plagued with all kinds of technological, scientific and ethic problems. In this paper, we consider the requirements for terraformation, i.e., for changing a given environment to make it hospitable to some given class of life forms. Although the standard use of this term involved strategies for planetary terraformation, it has been recently suggested that this approach could be applied to a very different context: ecological communities within our own planet.

        <span class="abst" title="Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the most important energy storage system. Separators in the battery play a critical role in terms of the rate capability, cycle life, and safe operation. However, commercial separators exhibit poor electrolyte wettability and limited safety. It is also extremely important to eliminate the hazardous small molecules (e.g., H2O and HF) inside the battery to enhance the service life. Herein, a functionalized poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)@polyacrylonitrile (PVDF-HFP@PAN) separator modified by 4-Å molecular sieves (MS) was fabricated by hydrothermal method for LIBs. MS@PVDF-HFP@PAN separator exhibits high thermal stability and carbonate electrolyte wettability. In addition, it can lower the moisture value in the battery system to 13 ppm, which significantly improves the electrolyte quality. When the current density increased from 0.2 to 5 C, the discharging capacity of the cell with MS@PVDF-HFP@PAN declines from 177.6 to 143.2 mAh g-1, demonstrating an excellent capacity retention of 80.6%. The discharge capacity retention of NMC622 half-cell with MS@PVDF-HFP@PAN after 100 cycles is 98.6% of its initial discharge capacity, which is higher than that of a cell with the Celgard 2400 separator (91.9%).">

        <span class="abst" title="A logical strategy to contain the Covid-19 pandemic is to completely isolate everyone for 2 weeks (the incubation period of the virus). However, such a strategy can have prohibitive economic and social costs and, therefore, will be difficult to implement. At the same time, the current situation is leading to an expanding humanitarian, health and economic crisis. Based on principles of the Theory of Constraints, we propose in this article the &quot;Shutting-down Transmission Of Pandemic&quot; (STOP Covid-19) plan that would reliably contain the pandemic, mitigate its economic consequences, and boost societal confidence. This plan requires the implementation of four strategies over 90 days: (a) stop all international, domestic passenger air and intercity bus/train travel; (b) create administrative zones of about 1 million people; (c) stop all non-emergency cross-zonal travel except for transportation of goods, and (d) deploy an information-driven service value chain to control the spread of the pandemic within a zone.">
