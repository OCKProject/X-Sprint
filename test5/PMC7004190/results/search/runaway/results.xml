 <result pre="Comparisons with other putative handicap models Grafen also compared his" exact="model" post="to previous interpretations of the Handicap Principle (i.e. three"/>
 <result pre="models proposed by Maynard Smith (1985). First, he compared his" exact="model" post="to Zahavi's (fixed) handicap model, which had previously been"/>
 <result pre="model, and again he emphasized their differences. He interpreted this" exact="model" post="as predicting that males honestly demonstrate their quality by"/>
 <result pre="by undertaking ‘some onerous task’, and he argued that this" exact="model" post="does not operate as a signal because ‘the content"/>
 <result pre="His interpretation differs from Maynard Smith (1985), who proposed this" exact="model" post="to explain signals that are honest because individuals are"/>

 <result pre="2014; Biernaskie, Perry &amp;amp; Grafen, 2018). Third, Grafen compared his" exact="model" post="with Zahavi's (1977b) ‘condition‐dependent handicap,’ but he underestimated their"/>
 <result pre="539). His interpretation closely matches Maynard Smith's (1985) conditional handicap" exact="model" post="[which was an over‐simplification of West‐Eberhard's (1979) description of"/>
 <result pre="Thus, we see no distinction between Grafen's strategic choice handicap" exact="model" post="and Zahavi's second hypothesis, which is why we refer"/>
 <result pre="(Zahavi, 1977b; Grafen, 1990a). Grafen (1990a) then concluded that his" exact="model" post="supports Zahavi's Handicap Principle, and moreover, he argued that"/>
 <result pre="their book, The Handicap Principle, the Zahavis only mention Grafen's" exact="model" post="in one sentence and merely to explain how this"/>
 <result pre="&amp;amp; Zahavi, 1997, p. XV). There are similarities between Grafen's" exact="model" post="and the Handicap Principle, but their differences are far"/>
 <result pre="findings vindicated the Handicap Principle: First, he argued that his" exact="model" post="shows that signals are honest because they are costly"/>
 <result pre="1995; Számadó, 1999; Lachmann et al., 2001). Honesty in Grafen's" exact="model" post="is due to a particular assumption, i.e. marginal and"/>
 <result pre="2000). Reliable signals can also evolve in a differential benefit" exact="model" post="(Godfray, 1991; Getty, 1998a; Godfray &amp;amp; Johnstone, 2000) and"/>
 <result pre="equilibrium signal costs nor differential costs are required for the" exact="model" post="to work this way (see Section VII.6). Second, Grafen"/>
 <result pre="attract females, but this is incorrect. Grafen concluded that his" exact="model" post="‘affirms Zahavi's (1987) claim that natural selection on a"/>
 <result pre="the crucial criterion that inspired Dawkins to conclude that Grafen's" exact="model" post="was ‘full‐bloodied Zahavian’ (Dawkins, 1989) (p. 312). Thus, none"/>

 <result pre="main handicap results The equations for Grafen's (1990a) strategic signalling" exact="model" post="do not stand up to scrutiny either, as they"/>

 <result pre="signalling model There are additional reasons why Grafen's (1990a) signalling" exact="model" post="lacks generality (Fig. 2). First, differential costs are not"/>
 <result pre="and they have been interpreted as generalizing Grafen's strategic choice" exact="model" post="to other signalling contexts (Johnstone, 1997; Laidre &amp;amp; Johnstone,"/>
 <result pre="(and cost/benefit trade‐offs). Second, it has been suggested that Grafen's" exact="model" post="is limited to signals with additive costs and benefits,"/>
 <result pre="for reliability (Fudenberg &amp;amp; Tirole, 1991). Finally, Grafen's (1990a) signalling" exact="model" post="does not address whether females obtain genetic benefits by"/>
 <result pre="this defect, as we show next. (7) Grafen's population genetic" exact="model" post="of sexual selection The main biological conclusions of this"/>

 <result pre="but there are no indirect, genetic benefits or costs. The" exact="model" post="does not address whether the benefits of mating with"/>
