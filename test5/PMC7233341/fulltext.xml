is likely that the &#x0201c;fibrosis&#x0201d; will need to be identified before it has led
to widespread architectural destruction of the parenchyma. Unfortunately, by the time
IPF is diagnosed, most patients have suffered symptoms for a number of years (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and have considerable physiological
abnormality, with reduced FVC and gas transfer (D<sc>l</sc><sub>CO</sub>) and
irreversible loss of lung function (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, step one on the path to cure IPF requires that early precursor lesions must be
identified in presymptomatic individuals at a point at which the natural history can be
positively altered. We&#x02019;ve all seen the movie: the runaway train barreling down
the tracks but somehow the hero manages to divert the course.</p><p>In the last decade, a number of studies assessing radiological changes in longitudinal
cohorts of people without obvious IPF-identified parenchymal changes, referred to as
interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs), have demonstrated an increase in both all-cause
mortality and mortality from pulmonary fibrosis (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), raising the prospect that
ILAs may be the precursor lesions for IPF. Furthermore, there is overlap in the genetic
architecture of IPF and ILA (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and, indeed,
serum biomarkers associated with pulmonary fibrosis are associated with ILA (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). This raises two fundamental questions:
<italic>1</italic>) are ILAs a precursor lesion for IPF and, if so,
<italic>2</italic>) should at-risk populations be screened for them?</p><p>I started to write this editorial on Groundhog Day (February 2, 2020), and folklore
suggests that the groundhog&#x02019;s shadow can lead to its prediction of the duration
of winter; however, the phrase has come to epitomize the futility of trying to change
the future even when you know what is going to happen. This could be an even greater
concern when the future is less than certain. The prevalence of ILA is high, between 7%
and 9% of screened populations (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which would
suggest that if ILAs were indeed precursor lesions, the incidence of IPF should be much
higher than currently reported (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Will identification of ILAs offer us the
chance to save the runaway train or will it just lead to a Groundhog Day of recurrent
harm associated with lead-time bias&#x02013;related anxiety or adverse effects associated
with overdiagnosis?</p><p>In this issue of the <italic>Journal</italic>, studies by Salisbury and colleagues (pp.
<ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1164/rccm.201909-1834OC">1230&#x02013;1239</ext-link>) and Hunninghake and colleagues (pp. <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1164/rccm.201908-1571OC">1240&#x02013;1248</ext-link>) provide data that help inform the answers to these two
crucial questions (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Both these studies use computed tomography scanning to
&#x0201c;screen&#x0201d; unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with familial
pulmonary fibrosis (FPF), and the study by Hunninghake and colleagues also screens
first-degree relatives of patients with sporadic IPF. Both studies used a similar
definition of ILA, and the rates of observed ILA in relatives of patients with FPF were
similar across the cohorts (23% of the Vanderbilt cohort and 26% in the Brigham Cohort).
The presence of the minor allele of the <italic>MUC5B</italic> promoter polymorphism
rs35705950 and shorter telomeres were associated with ILAs in both cohorts. These data
are similar to findings by Mathai and colleagues (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Although Mathai and colleagues used a different definition of ILA,
which they termed preclinical pulmonary fibrosis, they found 18% of first-degree
relatives had an ILA, with 15.6% being described as fibrotic and, by the authors
definition, preclinical pulmonary fibrosis. They also found an association between the
<italic>MUC5B</italic> promoter variant and ILA but not the common variant of
<italic>TERT,</italic> although they did not measure telomere length. All three
studies showed an association between increasing age and ILAs, with the age of those
with an ILA being a mean of 59 years (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), a
median of 61 years (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and a mean of 66 years
(<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) compared with a mean of 52 years
(<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), a median of 58 years (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and a mean of 56 years (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), respectively, in those without ILA. A
remarkable finding by Hunninghake and colleagues was that there were, if anything, more
people with ILAs in those screened who were related to patients with sporadic IPF (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). If ILAs really are precursor lesions for
IPF, then it would appear that there is more heritable disease than currently
recognized. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that ILAs are precursor lesions
of IPF, the latter presenting late in 60th decade or early in the 70th decade (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), but are also associated with the
<italic>MUC5B</italic> polymorphism and short telomeres (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, it is
a little premature to describe even fibrotic ILAs as preclinical pulmonary fibrosis
because the natural history of these lesions is still not known and there do appear to
be some key differences that need to be clarified.</p><p>In contrast with IPF, the majority of patients with ILAs in all three cohorts were
female, although this is similar to the observations in FPF. This may indicate a
difference between males and females in their fibrogenic exposures; disease progression;
or, indeed, physician gender bias when making a diagnosis of sporadic IPF as opposed to
FPF. Furthermore, demographic differences were observed in relation to ever-smoking with
lower rates in ILA than would be expected in IPF, with less than 50% of those with
observed with ILA describing themselves as ever-smokers. However, the risk of having ILA
compared with no ILA was only lower in male ever-smokers in one study (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Therefore, it might be possible that ILAs are
precursor lesions in those with additional risk factors such as male sex, ever-smoking
history, <italic>MUC5B</italic> polymorphism, and short telomeres. However, for this to
be confirmed, it is crucial to know the natural history of ILA because the defining
feature of IPF is its remorselessly progressive nature (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Unfortunately, only one study directly addressed this, and then only in
129 patients. However, after five years of follow-up, almost 20% had developed
study-defined interstitial lung disease (ILD). Most of these were in patients with an
ILA at enrollment, although six relatives without an ILA at enrollment went on to
develop an ILD (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). These rates of progression
are substantially lower than observed in AGES (Age Gene/Environment
Susceptibility)-Reykjavik study in which 73% of 327 patients progressed radiologically
over five years (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Another concern is that these studies are just revealing undiagnosed pulmonary fibrosis.
It is well-recognized that patients present after years of increasing symptoms (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). However, it seems unlikely that the study by
Salisbury and colleagues was revealing undiagnosed disease because only 4% had extensive
ILA and there was little functional difference between patients with or without ILA,
with near-normal lung function in the small number of patients with available data
(<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, in contrast, 18% of people in
the study by Hunninghake and colleagues had changes sufficiently extensive to merit the
label of an ILD even though they had a fairly well-preserved FVC, although a
substantially reduced D<sc>l</sc><sub>CO</sub>, and a number required treatment with an
antifibrotic (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Should we screen people for ILA? The two major risks for any screening intervention are
lead-time bias and harm due to overdiagnosis. Given the nature of antifibrotic therapy,
it would seem that lead-time bias should not be a major concern, at least in health care
settings outside of the United Kingdom. However, in the United Kingdom, lead-time bias
would be a major problem because, perversely, patients would still need to progress
until their FVC dropped to 80% predicted before they would be eligible for treatment to
slow progression. The risk of overdiagnosis is, however, a considerable risk.
Antifibrotic therapies have considerable adverse effects (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and their
long-term adverse effects are uncertain, especially for nintedanib, and so it would be
difficult to recommend therapy for an ILA if it was not certain to progress to
progressive fibrotic lung disease. Furthermore, the economic effects of treating 10% of
the population over the age of 55 years with antifibrotics would not be trivial in any
health care setting.</p><p>Therefore, the ILD community urgently needs to determine which patients have ILAs that
will progress and which have ILAs that will not. This will require carefully performed
longitudinal studies with appropriately conducted and validated risk prediction models.
This is step two to curing IPF! It is frustrating that the three studies investigating
screening of first-degree relatives published in the last 12 months used different
definitions of ILA (9&#x02013;11), and did not collect standardized lung function,
symptom, or follow-up data. Definitely more Groundhog Day than runaway train.</p><p>It is crucial, given the small number of people with ILAs in such studies, that
definitions are standardized to both maximize the potential for meta-analysis and also
to develop appropriate management protocols. More importantly, given the risk of
overdiagnosis, there urgently needs to be agreement on how to distinguish an ILA from an
ILD and define when treatment should be initiated. For example, should a 55-year-old
female with no symptoms and normal FVC and D<sc>l</sc><sub>CO</sub> but with evidence of
honeycombing and traction change on high-resolution computed tomographic imaging be
labeled as having an ILA or a fibrotic ILD in need of antifibrotic therapy? Would the
label change in the presence of an appropriate exposure history, genetic architecture,
or biomarker profile? These are urgent questions that need answering and, once again, I
find myself calling for collaboration between groups to address these time-pressured
questions. Groundhog Day again?!</p><p>These studies highlight the enormous potential that screening people for ILAs holds and
how crucial it will be to cure IPF. However, who to screen; when to screen; how often to
screen; and, most importantly, what to do when an ILA is discovered remain to be
determined. I have little doubt that if the community can work together and build on the
fascinating results presented in these two important studies, we will all be the heroes
as we prevent the runaway train of progressive fibrosis and find a way to cure patients
with IPF.</p></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Originally Published in Press as DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202002-0260ED">10.1164/rccm.202002-0260ED</ext-link> on February 20, 2020</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><underline><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/suppl/10.1164/rccm.202002-0260ED/suppl_file/disclosures.pdf">Author disclosures</ext-link></bold></underline> are available with
