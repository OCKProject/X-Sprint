Here we report strong departure from this expectation for common, homogeneous ionic solids such as alkali silicate glasses when subjected even to moderate fields (~100&#x02009;V/cm). Unlike electronically conducting metals and semiconductors, with time the heating of ionically conducting glass becomes extremely inhomogeneous with the formation of a nanoscale alkali-depletion region, such that the glass melts near the anode, even evaporates, while remaining solid elsewhere. <italic>In situ</italic> infrared imaging shows and finite element analysis confirms localized temperatures more than thousand degrees above the remaining sample depending on whether the field is DC or AC. These observations unravel the origin of recently discovered electric field induced softening of glass. The observed highly inhomogeneous temperature profile point to the challenges for the application of Joule&#x02019;s law to the electrical performance of glassy thin films, nanoscale devices, and similarly-scaled phenomena.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-0844014</award-id><award-id>DMR-0844014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McLaren</surname><given-names>Charles T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Himanshu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Joule&#x02019;s first law, sometimes also referred as the Joule&#x02013;Lenz law, describes heat produced from passing of electrical current through a conductor (resistor)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Most simply, it states that heat is produced in proportion to the square of electrical current that passes through a material. This statement is readily verified with homogeneous conductors or semiconductors. For inhomogeneous materials, such as composites, the law can be suitably extended by restating that heat is produced in proportion to the square of <italic>local</italic> electrical field as constant current passes through the sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Thus, if the material comprises of regions of varying resistance, there will be corresponding variation of field according to Ohm&#x02019;s law, and hence the heat produced. Such trivial expressions of Joule heating are well-established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, much less is known about the manifestation of Joule&#x02019;s law for the case of a material that is homogeneous to begin with, but wherein the effect itself (by migrating charge-carriers) may modify the material over time (of course, the validity of fundamental Joule effect at the local level remains unquestioned, at least for the time and length scales investigated here and encountered in common applications)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A scenario of such a time dependent, electric field-induced modification of a material was proposed to explain a recently discovered phenomenon: the electric field induced softening (EFIS) of model alkali silicate glasses. EFIS, as described below, has been the primary motivation behind this study, but its implications are far-reaching for the electrical performance of ionic solids such as common glasses and crystalline dielectrics, and even more so in thin film and nanoscale devices where inhomogeneity can become deleterious more readily.</p><p id="Par3">Glasses have been used in a variety of electrical applications, most notably as insulators, substrates for microelectronics, discrete dielectric elements, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. They serve multiple purposes within electrical components, which include keeping electrical contacts from shorting by allowing little to no current flow, increasing the effective capacitance of a component, and/or allowing for high voltage operation of a component without dielectric breakdown. A failure of the last condition occurs when the local electric field strength exceeds the material&#x02019;s ability to resist current flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Once a critical electric field (dielectric strength) has been exceeded, breakdown of the material occurs and allows for large current flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This process has been observed in many glasses, thin insulating films, and other dielectrics, but is not always easily measured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Factors influencing dielectric breakdown strength often link to intrinsic material properties, but also extrinsic factors such as voltage rise rate, surface defects, and external temperature. For example, as the temperature of silicate glass increases, its dielectric strength decreases dramatically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. A common mechanism associated with typical field conditions in various glasses and polymers is the so-called thermal runaway due to high power densities and Joule heating leading to a catastrophic rise in current flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thermal runaway can soften, melt and ultimately vaporize the dielectric material if not limited. Modeling of various kinds has estimated temperatures to rise to the order of 1000&#x02019;s of degrees Celsius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, little direct experimental data is available on temperature during the dielectric breakdown process in glass until recently under DC-EFIS conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Modern technologies and processing techniques have been able to take advantage of the dielectric properties of glass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For example, glass has been processed in a variety of innovative ways to create waveguides, enable through-glass vias for use as dielectric components, or even create surface structures for use with chip-on-glass applications, integrated circuits, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Glass softening via EFIS at much lower furnace temperatures (T<sub>furnace</sub>) than that obtainable through conventional heating has been demonstrated using both externally applied AC and DC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Flash sintering of glass powder is believed to be intimately related to EFIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. This phenomenon has been exploited in improving the fabrication of quantum dots in a glass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The mechanism of EFIS assumes multiple cascading events under applied voltage at elevated temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The process has largely been attributed to, first, the formation of a highly resistive alkali ion depletion layer near the anode which undergoes dielectric breakdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. It is then followed by large current flow and thermal runaway through the sample, eventually resulting in viscous flow of the glass samples. Intriguingly, wisps of vapor could be visibly seen near the glass-anode interface during resistive heating and thermal runaway in EFIS (see Supplemental Video in)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This observation is an indication that highly non-uniform, immense heating occurs, which could not be predicted from classical Joule&#x02019;s law proposed for homogeneous bulk materials. The present study aims to assess the applicability of Joule&#x02019;s law on the micrometer scale to electrical heating of ionic solids, especially common silicate glasses, as well as the mechanism of EFIS and dielectric breakdown of glass by measuring accurately the sample surface temperature using <italic>in situ</italic> thermal infrared imaging with state-of-the-art infrared thermal imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The initiation temperature and alkali ion depletion layer thickness (&#x003b4;) dependencies for thermal runaway are calculated using finite element analysis (FEA), which provide insight into the effect of variables that are hard to control experimentally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par5">Manifestations of localized Joule heating are most clearly seen as physical softening and large deformation of glass samples, which should be otherwise solid at the ambient temperature of the furnace wherein the EFIS experiment is performed. Therefore, we summarize the key observations of EFIS first, which are similar to those reported previously: When heating the sample at a constant rate and applied voltage, thermally stimulated polarization current exhibited a large step-change at some temperature wherein 30&#x02009;seconds or less, the glass softens and deforms under the applied load<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

After 30&#x02009;s of runaway at a starting temperature of 277&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (500&#x02009;K), the temperature of the depletion layer increases to nearly 1525&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

At 5&#x02009;nm thickness, the depletion layer resistance was low, preventing it from having much influence over the resistance of the bulk, therefore, the bulk of sample heated quicker than the depletion layer. This resulted in a thermal profile that was symmetric, with the center of the bulk being the hottest at about 750&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. An increase of &#x003b4; to 50&#x02009;nm increased the resistance of the depletion layer, allowing for dramatic localized heating up to 1450&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Here, within the first 20&#x02009;s of dielectric breakdown brought about by the large current passage, very localized regions of the glass near the anode are heated up.

Since the furnace heating rate was 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/min and the two images were captured within 40&#x02009;s of each other, the massive difference in sample temperature is attributed to thermal runaway. For the DC case in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the hottest temperature measurement was on the anode side of the glass similar to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

Evidently, resistive heating in AC-EFIS could be more controllable compared to the dramatic thermal runaway of DC-EFIS.</p><p id="Par20">The observed difference in the IR images for DC and AC fields is supported by measured power density per unit volume. Power in DC-EFIS was calculated by voltage and current while in AC-EFIS it was calculated by RMS voltage and current [The power calculated from the RMS values of voltage and current includes a non-heating component, resulting in a power factor of less than one. Its value is difficult to determine directly due to the continuously varying temperature and depletion layer resistance, but this factor would not change the present conclusion.]. For example, NS glass tested with 150&#x02009;V in DC measured a maximum power density of 91&#x02009;mW/mm<sup>3</sup>, whereas with 150&#x02009;V - 1&#x02009;kHz AC it had a maximum of 55&#x02009;mW/mm<sup>3</sup>. A similar trend was measured with 5L5NS composition with 150&#x02009;V applied. In DC, it had a maximum power density of 78&#x02009;mW/mm<sup>3</sup>, but with 150&#x02009;V - 1&#x02009;kHz AC the power density was 54&#x02009;mW/mm<sup>3</sup>. It should be noted that in DC, the power dissipation is much more local near the anode compared to the AC case, which would exaggerate the difference in power density per unit volume.</p><p id="Par21">The self-heating of NS in AC is uniform, and the hottest measurement was in the center of the sample between the electrodes. This profile indicates that resistive Joule heating is likely a result of the oscillating voltage that makes current flow and Joule heating start and stop every half-cycle of the frequency. By comparison, the use of DC voltage leads to extreme localized heating and glass softening, while AC contributes to uniform heating and gradual softening. As discussed in previous AC-EFIS work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the application of an AC voltage creates two processes that the mobile cations undergo. In the first half-cycle of the AC voltage, the electrode has a temporary positive bias that drives mobile cations away from the electrode/glass interface into the bulk. Ion migration dominates diffusion in this half-cycle. In the second half-cycle, the bias is temporarily reversed, now there is a large cation concentration gradient driving diffusion of cations back toward the depletion layer and the reversed voltage bias drives cation migration back as well. This process likely prevents dielectric breakdown and intense localized heating as measured in DC-EFIS.</p><p id="Par22">The exponential rise of current in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> reveals the positive feedback of resistive heating. However, the rise in current reaches an asymptote showing a competition between heat generation via resistive heating, versus heat loss through convection into the electrodes and radiation into the surrounding furnace. The calculated temperatures along with the thermal profile match well with experimental measurements. Thermal imaging showed that temperatures above 1300&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were often reached when using DC voltages. A maximum temperature of 1868&#x02009;&#x000b0;C was measured in NS near the depletion layer region during DC-EFIS with 150&#x02009;V after ~30&#x02009;s of dielectric breakdown, as seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. These calculations suggest that glass softening occurs from anode toward cathode as heat transfers from depletion layer into the bulk of the glass sample. This supposition is supported by Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. Finite element modeling predicts an overall depletion layer temperature of about 1600&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, while infrared imaging measured about 1800&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The discrepancy in values could result from FEA modeling the sample as a one-dimensional solid, which does not take into account heat buildup in the center of the glass with a radial temperature gradient. The model also used temperature-independent thermal conductivity for calculations.</p><p id="Par23">In the FEA model setup, a current limit using a logic statement was imposed at 0.3A, which was larger than the asymptote reached during FEA. A similar current maximum of about 0.23A was similarly measured experimentally during EFIS, as seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>. The series power resistor limited the maximum current to 0.5A in theory, but was never fully reached experimentally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. A comparison of the theoretical and experimental current asymptotes shows that the EFIS process is self-sustaining. Current flow through the glass dissipates as heat that increases the temperature and enhances ionic migration and diffusion. However, the creation of a silica-rich region increases sample resistance, preventing further exponential increase in current. This limitation of heat generation was not observed during AC-EFIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The power dissipation continually increased during AC-EFIS but the softening event occurred at lower furnace temperature. The latter fact was reported as a result of the sample being heated more uniformly and softened gradually, as opposed to DC-EFIS which was sudden and dramatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

For very small &#x003b4;, say at 5&#x02009;nm, the resistivity of the depletion layer did not create localized heating near the anode. Instead, uniform Joule heating was experienced in the bulk of the glass. The heat that was generated within the 5&#x02009;nm depletion layer could dissipate quickly out into the electrode by conduction. The maximum temperature experienced by the depletion layer was when its thickness was 100&#x02009;nm. A &#x003b4; beyond 100&#x02009;nm began to limit the amount of current that could pass through the sample due to the larger resistance of the depletion layer. In turn, the reduced current decreased the attendant Joule heating effects, as seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. Consequently, thermal runaway is either extended to a longer time scale or suppressed to where heat loss is no longer negligible compared to heat generation and comes to a steady state. This insight gained by thermal modeling explains dynamic Joule heating as observed through experimental thermal imaging.</p><p id="Par25">Thermal imaging videos show that the heating during EFIS near the anode is highly localized and non-uniform. The localized &#x02018;hot spot&#x02019; also tends to meander around, laterally, at the anode/glass interface. The FEA model results explain this observation, where intense localized heating creates a large &#x003b4; due to thermally-enhanced migration of cations. The &#x003b4; can then grow to be on the order of 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;m as measured by EDS linescans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Upon reaching a relatively &#x02018;thick&#x02019; depletion layer of 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;m, the thermal runaway becomes suppressed in that local region by limited current through the more resistive layer. This process serves as a negative feedback loop of the dielectric material&#x02019;s ability to sustain current in that localized area. However, in a region adjacent to the localized heating, conditions may be conducive for dielectric breakdown to continue by traversing laterally over to an adjacent region that was heated by the nearby thermal runaway event but retained an &#x02018;optimal&#x02019; value of &#x003b4; at ~100&#x02009;nm. The thermal runaway process continues in this new region, until in turn it also becomes suppressed by a growing depletion layer, causing it to move to a neighboring region again, and so on. As neighboring &#x02018;hot spot&#x02019; regions join each other, the collective resistance of the extended depletion layer will decrease, and sufficient heat will be generated to initiate EFIS. Thus, heat transfer from the depletion layer into the bulk will eventually result in the bulk sample temperature reaching softening temperatures, allowing for viscous flow to occur.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par26">The key message of this work is that electrical heating in ionically conducting glasses is substantially different from that predicted by classical Joule&#x02019;s law and observed in electronically conducting metals and semiconducting materials. The difference arises due to the development of an ion depletion layer in the former, which makes the sample electrically inhomogeneous with time. The resistance of this very thin layer (&#x02264;100&#x02009;nm) can be orders of magnitude higher than the underlying bulk glass. These characteristics produce extremely high local fields that can increase the temperature locally by 1400&#x02009;&#x000b0;C or higher than the remaining glass, causing dielectric breakdown, melting, and even evaporation of the sample. Furthermore, photoemissions and localized heating are observed to occur simultaneously in the same area of glass, which meander around randomly along the anode/glass interface under the influence of a DC field. These observations call for a micro-scale version of Joule&#x02019;s law that incorporates field-induced, localized, dynamic electrical inhomogeneity, and enhanced cation mobility due to localized heating.</p><p id="Par27">The <italic>in situ</italic> measurements of sample temperature by infrared imaging, coupled with modeling of electrical heating of ionically conducting silicate glasses, provide new insights into the recently discovered EFIS phenomenon. The results show the existence of an optimum thickness of ion depletion layer for which dielectric breakdown and EFIS are most likely to occur. FEA calculations of DC-EFIS for alkali disilicate glass predict regions within the sample to reach temperatures of about 1600&#x02009;&#x000b0;C&#x02014;far above the ambient furnace temperature of 427&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Thermal imaging of DC-EFIS experimentally corroborates a sample surface temperature of about 1800&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. Thermal imaging of AC-EFIS shows relatively homogeneous resistive heating, which leads to more uniform heating and softening of the entire sample. By comparison, under DC field the sample softens, starting at the anode and then moving toward cathode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Experimental Methods</title><p id="Par28">Similar to prior studies, in these experiments we focus on a series of alkali disilicate glasses.

The T<sub>g</sub> value for each composition is listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Samples were ground and polished to create rectangular bars with a final cross-section of 5&#x02009;mm x 5&#x02009;mm and a height of 10&#x02009;mm. Conductive carbon paste was applied to the end-faces of the glass samples to ensure good electrical contact with the solid graphite electrodes.</p><p id="Par29">For EFIS measurements with <italic>in situ</italic> thermal imaging, a C-shaped bracket was used to hold graphite electrodes in contact with the sample during heating and provide a &#x02018;backdrop&#x02019; for the camera. Either AC (60&#x02009;Hz or 1&#x02009;kHz) or DC voltage, ranging from 100 to 200&#x02009;V, was applied across the sample, with a power resistor connected in series that limited the current to 0.5A, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. All the bar samples were held vertically in the furnace and heated at a constant rate of 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/min under a 1&#x02009;MPa compressive load until DC- or AC-EFIS occurred. In DC-EFIS experiments, the positively-biased electrode (anode) was always located at the top of the image, while the cathode was kept at the bottom.</p><p id="Par30">In some instances, a powdery white material was deposited on the surfaces of adjacent support structures. Samples of this powder were analyzed in a Zeiss 1550 scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS).</p><p id="Par31">For high quality infrared (IR) imaging, the longer side faces of the bar samples were ground to 130&#x02009;&#x000b5;m surface roughness, since a smoother surface produced reflection that altered the IR measurements. Two IR cameras were used for thermal imaging: (a) An FLIR SC8303HD-HS F/4 BHP 3&#x02013;5um 1344X784 comprising a 100&#x02009;mm lens with a 65&#x02009;mm extension, which allowed for focusing on the sample surface 24.4&#x02009;cm away, inside the furnace through an IR-transparent window. The lens of the camera looking into a furnace port was cooled with a fan that resulted in an artifact vibration in the IR videos. The camera sensor had a 1344 pixel by 784 pixel resolution, providing an ultimate resolution of 0.03&#x02009;mm on the sample. Then a 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3 pixel matrix was averaged, achieving a resolution of 0.1&#x02009;mm.

The emissivity values for the NS and 5L5NS glass compositions were measured as 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, at a wavelength of 5.14&#x02009;&#x000b5;m ranging in temperature from 235&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to 540&#x02009;&#x000b0;C (see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Thermal images were analyzed using the ResearchIR (FLIR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Systems) software. (b) A Fluke TiX660 camera with the same setup as described above.

For thermal modeling of Joule heating, the electric current AC/DC module was combined with the module on heat transfer in solids using a multiphysics coupling of electromagnetic heat source and temperature. Two domains were created in series representing, respectively, the alkali ion depletion layer nearest the anode and the bulk glass properties. There are three limitations of the present FEA modeling of thermal runaway condition. First, the two domains modeling the alkali ion depletion layer and bulk of the sample are one-dimensional. Therefore, a radial temperature gradient from center-to-surface of the modeled glass is not considered. The only temperature gradient allowed is the thermal profile from anode to cathode. Second, the thermal conductivity of both the alkali ion depletion layer and bulk domains were set equal as well as temperature independent. Third, the model does not consider any heating due to current during dielectric breakdown beyond ionic conductivity under polarizing conditions.</p><p id="Par33">A set of material properties was assigned to each domain. The domain representing the alkali ion depletion layer was modeled as silica glass. Its temperature dependent electrical conductivity was taken from literature values following the relation &#x003c3;<sub>Silica</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;350*exp(&#x02212;1.3&#x02009;eV/k<sub>b</sub>*T) [S/m] where k<sub>b</sub> is Boltzmann&#x02019;s constant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The second domain was represented by the bulk NS glass material properties. The temperature dependent ionic conductivity of bulk NS was taken from impedance spectroscopy measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Comsol multiphysics&#x02019; nearest function interpolation method was used to extrapolate conductivities at higher sample temperatures using the following relation &#x003c3;<sub>NS</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12500*exp(&#x02212;0.61&#x02009;eV/k<sub>b</sub>*T) [S/m]. The change in temperature dependence from below to above T<sub>g</sub> was not accounted for in this model. The thermal conductivity of both domains was set to 1.38&#x02009;W/m.K, with a heat transfer coefficient for convective heat flow of 800&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup>.K<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The heat transfer coefficient used to calculate heat convection was assumed to remain constant. The emissivity was set at the measured values of 0.95 for NS and 0.96 for 5L5NS, respectively.</p><p id="Par34">The two domains consisted of three boundaries: the first outer boundary on the left of the depletion layer; the interface between depletion layer and bulk; and finally, the other outer boundary of the bulk. The first boundary (depletion layer domain) was designated as the anode with an initial voltage of 200&#x02009;V applied using a terminal boundary. The right outer boundary (bulk domain) was set as the cathode, where ground potential was established. The terminal boundary was used instead of an electric potential boundary to simulate the effect of a power resistor in series with the glass sample acting as a current limiting resistor to 0.3A, if needed. Convective heat flux was allowed at the outer boundaries while a diffuse surface boundary was used for heat loss through radiation along the length of the model. A cross-sectional area of 25 mm<sup>2</sup> was used to match the one used in EFIS experiments. The initial T<sub>furnace</sub> for calculating thermal runaway ranged from 500&#x02009;K (227&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) to 700&#x02009;K (427&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) in 50&#x02009;K intervals. Lastly, the depletion layer thickness dependence was calculated at 700&#x02009;K with its value ranging from 5&#x02009;nm to 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;m.</p><p id="Par35">The mesh for the depletion layer domain contained 200 elements. Typically, the &#x003b4;&#x02009;=&#x02009;100&#x02009;nm would have a mesh density of 2 elements/nm. In the bulk domain, only 500 elements were used to reduce computing time. The bulk mesh density was close to 50 elements/mm. Most experiments during EFIS exhibited viscous flow of the sample within 30&#x02009;s of entering region IV of EFIS associated with dielectric breakdown and thermal runaway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.
