   <result pre="model, and again he emphasized their differences. He interpreted this" exact="model" post="as predicting that males honestly demonstrate their quality by"/>

   <result pre="His interpretation differs from Maynard Smith (1985), who proposed this" exact="model" post="to explain signals that are honest because individuals are"/>

   <result pre="2014; Biernaskie, Perry &amp;amp; Grafen, 2018). Third, Grafen compared his" exact="model" post="with Zahavi's (1977b) ‘condition‐dependent handicap,’ but he underestimated their"/>

   <result pre="Thus, we see no distinction between Grafen's strategic choice handicap" exact="model" post="and Zahavi's second hypothesis, which is why we refer"/>
   <result pre="(Zahavi, 1977b; Grafen, 1990a). Grafen (1990a) then concluded that his" exact="model" post="supports Zahavi's Handicap Principle, and moreover, he argued that"/>

   <result pre="findings vindicated the Handicap Principle: First, he argued that his" exact="model" post="shows that signals are honest because they are costly"/>
   <result pre="1995; Számadó, 1999; Lachmann et al., 2001). Honesty in Grafen's" exact="model" post="is due to a particular assumption, i.e. marginal and"/>

   <result pre="(and cost/benefit trade‐offs). Second, it has been suggested that Grafen's" exact="model" post="is limited to signals with additive costs and benefits,"/>
