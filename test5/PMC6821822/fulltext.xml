Therefore, this study is aimed at investigating the effect of the microwaving on the properties of coal bottom ash(CBA) geopolymers. We prepared geopolymer samples by casting a mixture of ground CBA and 14&#x02009;M NaOH solution against cubic molds with a hand press machine, followed by pre-curing in a dry oven at 75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02009;h and microwaving under various powers and durations. The compressive strength strongly depended on the moisture content, <italic>i.e</italic>., the strength increased from 21 to 65&#x02009;MPa or higher as the moisture content decreased to critical values, after which the strength began to decrease. The results showed that microwave energy stimulated an additional geopolymerization by evaporating the redundant free water. This led to the strength gain, although the over-irradiation generated a high internal stress and poor structural integrity, which resulted in the strength loss. Therefore, the appropriate application of microwave energy is a promising option for synthesizing high-strength geopolymers in a cost- and time-effective manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Pollution remediation</kwd><kwd>Geochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Heung Kuk Industry</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Since the first discovery of the alkali-activated binders by V. Glukhovsky in 1959<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, intensive efforts have been put into examining and enhancing their physicochemical properties. The term &#x0201c;geopolymer&#x0201d; was coined by J. Davidovits in the late 1970s to describe the inorganic polymeric system synthesized from the alkali activation of metakaolin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and it has become the most generic term for referring to the material today<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that the framework of geopolymers consists of SiO<sub>4</sub> and AlO<sub>4</sub> that are tetrahedrally linked by covalently bonded oxygen atoms, while cations (<italic>e.g</italic>., Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>), sourced from alkaline solutions balance the negative charge of Al<sup>3+</sup> in a 4-fold coordinate system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Geopolymers have been shown to attain a compressive strength as high as or higher than that of Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in an early age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, as well as the outstanding resistance to fire/chemical attack, and a very low permeability, which is enough to immobilize heavy metals and radioactive wastes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In addition, geopolymers have advantages when it comes to dealing with environmental issues in comparison with OPC: not only can geopolymers be synthesized from industrial wastes or byproducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, but also the emission of a greenhouse gas during the production/utilization of geopolymers is equivalent to 10&#x02013;30% of the counterpart of OPC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Accordingly, geopolymers have received much attention as a &#x0201c;green&#x0201d; alternative construction material. To reveal the fundamentals of geopolymer chemistry and widen its applications, many researchers have employed various analytical techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Especially, A. Fern&#x000e1;ndez-Jim&#x000e9;nez and his group delineated the reaction mechanism of geopolymer synthesis, so called &#x0201c;geopolymerization&#x0201d;, into several successive steps that occur while overlapping each other to some extent. They are as follows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>: (1), dissolution of oligomers from the starting materials into the alkaline media; (2), polycondensation of these species to produce polymeric aluminosilicate structures; and (3), progressive incorporation of silicon into the matrix with a growth of crystal structures in a long term.</p><p id="Par3">Typically, geopolymers are synthesized by exposing a mixture of aluminosilicate sources and a highly concentrated alkali hydroxide solution (frequently with an alkali silicate), to a moderate temperature condition ranging from 50 to 90&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, for several tens of hours or up to a month<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although the geopolymers can also be produced under room temperature, the thermal treatment is more favorable given that the oligomer species are more readily dissolved in the alkaline media at the elevated temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The conventional curing method of geopolymer using a hot dry oven is, however, comparatively inefficient in terms of time and energy consumption. Recently, some researchers utilized an advanced, direct heating tool&#x02014; a microwave oven, in place of or in combination with the dry oven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. It was shown that high-strength geopolymers can be produced more effectively because microwave energy can promote the dissolution and polycondensation of precursor species due to its penetrative and fast heating characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Admittedly, microwave energy is not a panacea for the geopolymer synthesis considering the following. First, it is hard to accurately predict the response of geopolymers to the microwave irradiation because their dielectric characteristics are highly dependent on various factors, such as the type of alkali activator and the mix proportion of the geopolymer paste<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the microwave heating creates an &#x0201c;inverse temperature profile&#x0201d;: the temperature is highest at the center and decreases outwards, and it can lead to &#x0201c;thermal runaway&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, if the geopolymers are exposed to an intense microwave field, the vigorous dielectric heating would cause rapid evaporation of water and the thermal shrinkage of the matrix, which can induce cracks or fractures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, microwave energy still has a high potential as an effective tool for geopolymer synthesis so long as it is utilized cautiously. In the previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we demonstrated that the coal bottom ash (CBA)-based geopolymers could attain a high compressive strength by the additional use of microwave energy after a conventional dry-oven curing process.</p><p id="Par4">The focus of this study was to reveal the fundamentals of the change in the compressive strength resulting from the microwave irradiation, through examining the changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the geopolymer samples. That is, the compressive strength of the geopolymers were measured while manipulating the power and time of a household microwave oven; subsequently, the outcomes were corroborated by macroscopic observations, such as appearance inspection, temperature measurement, and moisture content evaluation as well as structural and morphological investigations by SEM, FTIR, and XRD. Simultaneously, this study proposed a practical synthesis method for high strength CBA-based geopolymers, which would extend the utilization of microwave energy on the geopolymer applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Raw materials</title><p id="Par5">The coal bottom ash (CBA) was provided from Yeongheung Power Plant, South Korea.

Extra pure grade NaOH pellets (Duksan, South Korea) were added into tap water with a magnetic stirrer at the pre-determined mass ratio. After cooling the solution to the ambient temperature (20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), it was blended with the CBA by a Hobart mixer for 5&#x02009;min at 60&#x02009;rpm. The mass ratio of the alkali activator to CBA (liquid/solid or L/S ratio) was determined as 0.40 from preliminary experiments. Thereafter, the mixture of the CBA and activator was cast against 50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;50&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;50&#x02009;mm<sup>3</sup> triplicate plastic molds by repeated compression with a hand-press machine.

After this pre-curing process, the samples were unwrapped and kept standing under the laboratory conditions until they cooled to the ambient temperature. Subsequently, they were exposed to microwave energy in a household microwave oven (MW25B, LG electronics, South Korea) at 200, 400, 600, 800, or 1,000&#x02009;W power. The microwave output was controlled by an inverter power supplier instead of an on-off sensor; consequently, it was able to radiate microwave energy continuously. The microwave irradiation time was set properly for each power level as suggested in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. When the heating time exceeded the given ranges, the samples suffered from large cracks or even fractures, and thus became incapable of undergoing the compression test.

Especially, the sample that was not exposed to the microwave energy will be called &#x0201c;Non-MW (microwave)&#x0201d;. In addition, for comparison of the compressive strength, we prepared two kinds of control samples: (1), after the precast samples were cured in the dry oven at 75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02009;h, they were unwrapped and stored in a humid chamber at 25&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 6 and 20 days; the samples were labelled &#x0201c;Ambi-7&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Ambi-21&#x0201d;, respectively; and (2), the precast samples were placed in the dry oven for 7 and 21 days without being unwrapped, and they were labelled &#x0201c;Oven-7&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Oven-21&#x0201d;, respectively.</p><p id="Par10">As mentioned above, the L/S ratio was determined as 0.40 from preliminary experiments. At the ratio, the raw mixture of the CBA and activator was in a slightly wet state, and so the precast samples were able to keep their shapes after being removed from the molds. When the alkali activator was added to CBA above this ratio, the raw mixture adopted an oozy state, which was unfavorable for the following reasons: (1), the impurities including unburnt carbon residues from the source material could gather upward and form a separate phase during the pre-curing process, which could hinder the development of the compressive strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>; (2), the samples become vulnerable to cracking or fracturing during the microwaving process as large amounts of water evaporate drastically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; and (3), the precast samples cannot be fabricated because they are unable to maintain their shapes out of the molds. Conversely, the geopolymer specimens that were prepared below the given L/S ratio showed a relatively poor compressive strength because the amount of the activator was not enough to alkali-activate the source material to a high degree. At the given L/S ratio, the precast samples were able to attain the high compressive strength without suffering from the carbon-phase separation or cracking during the hardening processes within the tested ranges. The optimal L/S ratio could be determined at the highest value as far as the precast samples were able to maintain their shapes without the molds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Property testing and structural characterizing methods</title><p id="Par11">To study the kinetics of the weight loss of the CBA-based geopolymer involved in heating, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed for the Non-MW sample (SDT-Q600, TA Instruments, USA). The powdered sample was heated up to 1,000&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at a rate of 10&#x02009;&#x000b0;C/min, and then burnt for a further 25&#x02009;min. Furthermore, the derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curve was obtained from the TGA data. To investigate the response of geopolymers to microwave heating, the surface temperature was measured by an infrared camera (E8, FLIR, USA) as soon as the microwave heating was completed. The average temperature over one side square was calculated through image processing (an average of the temperature data saved in each pixel), and the maximum and minimum surface temperatures were recorded as well. The temperature value at the regions heated beyond the measurable temperature range was estimated as 280&#x02009;&#x000b0;C during the calculation. Subsequently, the specimens were left standing under the laboratory conditions to cool to the ambient temperature in prior to the other property tests. The moisture content, which strongly affects the physical and chemical properties of geopolymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, was determined as follows. First, the moisture content of the Non-MW sample (WC<sub>Non-MW</sub>) was calculated by subtracting the LOI value of the Non-MW sample (=w1.3%, calculated based on the LOI estimate of CBA and the mix proportion of geopolymers) from the weight loss percent obtained from the TGA analysis (=16.1%, refer to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Therefore, the WC<sub>Non-MW</sub> value was determined as 16.1&#x02013;1.3&#x02009;=14.8%. Second, the mass of water contained in each pre-cured specimen (Water<sub>initial</sub>) was calculated by multiplying its weight and the WC<sub>Non-MW</sub> value. Third, the reduced weight of each sample during the microwave heating process was recorded as the mass of the evaporated water (Water<sub>evap.</sub>).

The compressive strength was measured to represent the mechanical strength of the synthesized geopolymer sample. The samples were subjected to a compression test (PL-9700H, Woojin, South Korea), in accordance with ASTM C109. To examine the micro-morphological and compositional transitions resulting from the microwave irradiation, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was employed (Inspect F50, FEI, USA). For the SEM inspection, some pieces of the broken samples were obtained after the compression test and coated with gold once. For the comparison of the EDS quantification results, only several specific elements (Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Na, and O) were considered to give 100%. In addition, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (ATR-FTIR) analysis was carried out (Frontier FT-IR Spectrometer, PerkinElmer, USA) to investigate the transitions in the chemical structure.

From the results, the thermal behavior of Non-MW geopolymer sample could be divided into three successive stages, each of which would be characterized as follows: Region I involves a rapid and substantial weight loss between room temperature and 120&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; Region II shows a relatively slow, but significant weight loss within the range of 120 &#x02212;350&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; and Region III represents a gradual but nominal weight loss beyond 350&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. The main factors that contributed to the weight loss in each region were different from one another. While the weight loss in Region I was primarily due to the evaporation of the physically bonded water, the loss of the chemically bonded water was mainly responsible for the weight loss in Region II, and the weight loss in the high-temperature range in Region III was attributed to dehydroxylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, it would be reasonable to ascribe the weight loss by LOI of the sample (=1.3%) to Region III because the decomposition of calcium compounds and combustion of residual would have occurred above 430&#x02009;&#x000b0;C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

The surface temperature distribution image taken by an infrared camera is given in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, with the average surface temperature results. Due to the vigorous dielectric heating, the average temperature increased above 100&#x02009;&#x000b0;C only after 7.5&#x02009;min under 200&#x02009;W power, and the higher watts resulted in faster heating, except for the cases where the samples were microwaved at 1,000&#x02009;W for longer than 2&#x02009;min as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref>. Considering that the water molecules were a chief source of heat during the microwave irradiation, the overly rapid evaporation of water at the first 2&#x02009;min under 1,000&#x02009;W (refer to Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a)</xref>) might have caused the slower heating thereafter. Thus, the microwave irradiation at 800&#x02009;W resulted in the fastest heating rate within the tested time ranges. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref> also shows that the average surface temperature exceeded 200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C when the samples were microwaved for the longest minutes corresponding to each power level given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, except for the 200&#x02009;W case. However, it did not mean that the entire volume of each sample was heated uniformly beyond 200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; in these cases, the temperature rose higher than the upper limit of the device (280&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) at the surface center, while it was as high as 130&#x02013;150&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at the rim. In fact, the microwave heating produced a non-uniform temperature distribution where the temperature was highest at around the center and decreased outwards, as depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(a)</xref>. This particular heat distribution, called &#x0201c;inverse temperature profile&#x0201d;, has been reported to occur within a few seconds when ceramics are exposed to microwave energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In contrast to the conventional dry-oven heating method, where heat is transferred from a surface to a core of an object by heat conduction, microwave energy heats the material throughout. However, as the samples are heated volumetrically and cooled from the outside, a temperature difference is created between the core and periphery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Afterward, the dielectric loss (&#x003b5;&#x02033;), which represents the degree to which electromagnetic energy is converted into heat energy, becomes higher at the hotter region, and in turn, it leads to the much faster heating at the core than the surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Due to this positive feedback between the dielectric heating and property, the temperature skyrockets at the core. Given that the infrared camera is only able to measure the surface temperature, we could guess that the temperature at the volumetric core must have risen much higher than that at the surface center (max. 280&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), and this drastic dielectric heating led to the thermal runaway as we have seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Infrared image of a microwaved sample overlapped with its side digital photograph (<bold>a</bold>), and average surface temperature versus microwave irradiation time profiles (<bold>b</bold>).

The moisture content results calculated from Eq. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) are given in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a)</xref>. The higher microwave power resulted in the faster weight loss; thus, the moisture content decreased to as low as 1.6% within the tested conditions. The moisture content results, depicted with respect to the microwave irradiation time, looked like the upside-down symmetric pattern of the average surface temperature seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref>, which suggested a strong correlation between the two properties. This speculation became evident as the average surface temperature results were expressed as a function of the moisture content. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref> shows that the temperature increment was so closely related to the moisture contents, that the average surface temperature results followed the same pattern, regardless of the microwave power level. The samples were heated rapidly up to 100&#x02009;&#x000b0;C at the initial stage of the microwave heating; however, the heating rate decreased as the temperature reached 120&#x02013;130&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, at which the moisture content fell below 6% due to the evaporation of the physically bonded water, and further heating made the average temperature soar again beyond 200&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which resulted in the evaporation of the chemically bonded water. This finding suggested that the physically bonded water was important for the thermal stability of the geopolymers under microwaving, in that it prevented the body temperature of the samples from jumping abruptly. Moreover, it was revealed that the microwave power level did not play a distinguishable role in determining the physical properties of the geopolymers, except that the lower power required the longer time to obtain the similar moisture content.</p><p id="Par17">As described above, the geopolymer specimens came to have an inverse temperature profile due to the distinctive heating characteristics of microwave energy. Moreover, the average surface temperature and moisture content were closely related to each other, while the microwave output was not meaningful.

At the initial stage of microwaving, the temperature at the surface center was higher than the minimum temperature by 60&#x02013;80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, as the inverse temperature profile created. However, the temperature gap decreased as the samples were further exposed to microwave energy because the temperature rose slowly at the center owing to the ongoing evaporation of the physically bound water, whereas the other part increased in temperature rapidly. After the moisture content became lower than 6%, the temperature difference began to increase again because the physically bonded water was completely evaporated at the center, while it was in progress at the outer region. Consequently, the temperature gap jumped to 110&#x02013;160&#x02009;&#x000b0;C; and then, the additional irradiation resulted in the thermal runaway. The effect of the power level of the microwave energy on the results was still imperceptible.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>The difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures on the samples&#x02019; surface expressed as a function of the moisture content.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_52160_Fig8_HTML" id="d29e1156"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Compressive strength</title><p id="Par18">In the previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, it was shown that microwave energy effectively enhanced the compressive strength of pre-cured CBA-based geopolymers, by evaporating redundant free water from the matrix. Additionally, there was a critical weight loss percent value, after which the compressive strength began to decrease as the over-evaporation of water induced serious thermal stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To corroborate these observations, the compressive strength outcomes obtained in this study are expressed with respect to the moisture content in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. The results clarified the strong correlation between the compressive strength and moisture content: as the moisture content reached the critical value at around 4&#x02013;6%, the compressive strength increased by more than three times in comparison to the value of the Non-MW sample (from 21.0 to 65&#x02013;70&#x02009;MPa), regardless of the microwave power level (called &#x0201c;strength-gaining period&#x0201d;); however, further irradiation resulted in the loss of the strength (called &#x0201c;strength-losing period&#x0201d;). It should be noted that the critical moisture content was attained only after a short time of microwave irradiation (<italic>i.e</italic>., 12.5&#x02013;15&#x02009;min at 200&#x02009;W, and 4&#x02013;6&#x02009;min at the higher powers; the optimum microwaving time for each power can be easily identified by comparing Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(b)</xref> and <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).

Nevertheless, the compressive strength reached only 43.3&#x02009;MPa even after 21 days (Abmi-21), which was much lower than the strength achieved by the microwave heating. The extended dry-oven curing under the elevated temperature (75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) for 7 days resulted in the higher compressive strength than that from the ambient curing, although it was also not as high as that of the microwaved samples. However, as the samples were exposed to the high temperature for the long period, the compressive strength showed deterioration rather than improvement (Oven-21, 41.3&#x02009;MPa). As a result, the trend of the compressive strength vs. moisture content of the oven-cured control samples was different from that of the experimental samples.

In contrast to the physically bound water, the chemically bound water plays a crucial role for the dimensional stability of the geopolymers, because it exists in the matrix hydrating the cations that balance the negative charge of Al in a 4-fold coordinated system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

Therefore, it would be reasonable to attribute the loss of the compressive strength to the high internal stress, which was induced by the evaporation of the chemically bound water that occurred as the geopolymer samples were overly microwaved.</p><p id="Par21">It is worth comparing the data shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> with the results from previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, where the CBA-based geopolymers achieved the highest compressive strength of 34.9&#x02013;41.5&#x02009;MPa as a result of pre-dry-oven curing at 75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and post-microwave heating under 700&#x02009;W power. First, the highest compressive strength was attained when the precast samples were reduced in weight by 13&#x02013;14%. In comparison, the compressive strength was highest when the precast samples lost 14.3&#x02013;15.9% of their weights in this study. Although the optimum weight loss was somewhat higher here than in the previous study, the results agreed well with each other considering that more amount of the alkali activator was used here (L/S&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.40; whereas, L/S&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.38 in the earlier study). Next, the maximum compressive strength was much higher in this study (65&#x02013;70&#x02009;MPa) than in the previous one in spite of the similar synthesis procedure. This could be ascribed to the better quality of the CBA used herein, namely: (1), the particle size was smaller, which could increase the reaction rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (mean size of 38.82 &#x003bc;m, compared to 44.57 &#x003bc;m in the previous study); (2), the amorphous phase content was higher, so the source material participated in the reaction more actively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (much larger amorphous hump in the XRD spectrum.

These morphological characteristics were partially responsible for the relatively low compressive strength of those samples.

However, as the geopolymer matrix becomes compacted along with the progress of the reaction, further dissolution and re-polymerization of the Si-O species occur, resulting in the increment in the Si/Al ratio (Si-rich phase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, the augmentation of the Si/Al molar ratio would represent the evolution of the reaction.

All the analytic techniques strongly showed that the microwave overheating generated the significant discrepancy between the volumetric core and periphery, and the inferior structural integrity was responsible to the deterioration of the compressive strength.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Figure 14</label><caption><p>Cross-sectional image of one of the 400W10M specimens, where internal deformation occurred; and SEM images of outer (&#x0201c;OUT&#x0201d;, (<bold>a</bold>)) and inner (&#x0201c;IN&#x0201d;, (<bold>b</bold>)) regions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_52160_Fig14_HTML" id="d29e2224"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>SEM-EDS results measured at four different points in the outer (&#x0201c;OUT&#x0201d;) and inner (&#x0201c;IN&#x0201d;) regions of 400W10M specimen.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2">Sample</th><th align="left">Si</th><th align="left">Al</th><th align="left">Fe</th><th align="left">Ca</th><th align="left">Na</th><th align="left">O</th><th align="left">Si/Al</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="4">400W10M-OUT</td><td>1</td><td>26.34</td><td>7.66</td><td>3.48</td><td>1.33</td><td>12.71</td><td>48.49</td><td>3.44</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>25.26</td><td>7.77</td><td>3.55</td><td>1.48</td><td>11.06</td><td>50.89</td><td>3.25</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>22.83</td><td>7.62</td><td>2.87</td><td>1.22</td><td>11.02</td><td>54.45</td><td>3.00</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>23.23</td><td>7.01</td><td>2.37</td><td>1.12</td><td>12.15</td><td>54.12</td><td>3.31</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">400W10M-IN</td><td>1</td><td>24.00</td><td>7.95</td><td>3.13</td><td>1.18</td><td>9.61</td><td>54.13</td><td>3.02</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>24.68</td><td>8.28</td><td>2.47</td><td>1.11</td><td>9.62</td><td>53.84</td><td>2.98</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>24.67</td><td>8.44</td><td>3.30</td><td>1.50</td><td>9.39</td><td>52.70</td><td>2.92</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>24.18</td><td>8.29</td><td>3.06</td><td>1.15</td><td>9.38</td><td>53.93</td><td>2.92</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption><p>FTIR spectra of the outer (&#x0201c;OUT&#x0201d;) and inner (&#x0201c;IN&#x0201d;) regions of the 400W10M specimen that were shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_52160_Fig15_HTML" id="d29e2486"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par29">In this study, we additionally utilized the household microwave oven after the conventional dry-oven curing process, in order to synthesize high-strength CBA-based geopolymers in a time- and cost-efficient manner. The precast samples were prepared by press-molding the raw mixture of the crushed CBA and well-regulated amount of 14&#x02009;M NaOH activator. These samples were heated in a dry oven at 75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02009;h, after which they were exposed to the microwave energy at powers of 200, 400, 600, 800, or 1,000&#x02009;W within the adequate time ranges. Not only did we observe the changes in the appearance of samples, but also, we measured the moisture content and body temperature after microwaving. Furthermore, various analytic techniques including SEM-EDS, ATR-FTIR, and RIR-XRD were performed for the morphological, chemical, and crystallographic characterization of the source material and geopolymer products. Therefore, we elucidated the mechanism of the variation in the compressive strength of the CBA-based geopolymers along with the microwave heating by consolidating all the results. The conclusions are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par30">The CBA-based geopolymers achieved a high compressive strength beyond 65&#x02009;MPa just after a single day of the dry-oven curing, followed by a short time of the microwave heating. The proposed method was proved to be very efficient given the samples achieved the much higher compressive strength than that of the control samples, which were cured at ambient or elevated temperature (75&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) for 7 and 21 days.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">As the moisture content of the geopolymers decreased from 14.8% to a critical value (4&#x02013;6%), as a result of the microwave heating, the compressive strength increased rapidly from 21.0 to above 65&#x02009;MPa. At this strength-gaining period, the microwave energy evaporated the redundant free water, and it initiated the additional geopolymerization reaction to enhance the macro/microscopic homogeneity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">As the moisture content decreased below the critical value (4&#x02013;6%) via subjection to further microwaving, the compressive strength began to deteriorate. At this strength-losing period, the microwave over-irradiation caused the loss of the chemically bonded water, which led to the high internal stress. Furthermore, thermal runaway occurred as the temperature skyrocketed at the core, and thus, the structural integrity worsened.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">The microwave energy, therefore, should be employed as far as it does not lead to the evaporation of the chemically bonded water, to achieve the high compressive strength. The optimal point was characterized by a moisture content of 4&#x02013;6% or an average surface temperature within 120&#x02013;130&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s note</bold> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The research for this paper was financially supported by the Heung Kuk Industry, Co., LTD, South Korea.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Hyo Kim set the aim of the study, circumscribed the experiments&#x02019; scope, revised all the figures and tables, supervised the experiments, and reviewed the main manuscript text.
