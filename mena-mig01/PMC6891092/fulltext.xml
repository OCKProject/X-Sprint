Durotaxis, the migration toward increasing matrix stiffness, has been implicated in processes ranging from development to cancer. During durotaxis, mechanical stimulation by matrix rigidity leads to directed migration. Studies suggest that cells sense mechanical stimuli, or mechanosense, through the acto-myosin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions (FAs); however, FA actin cytoskeletal remodeling and its role in mechanosensing are not fully understood. Here, we show that the Ena/VASP family member, Ena/VASP-like (EVL), polymerizes actin at FAs, which promotes cell-matrix adhesion and mechanosensing. Importantly, we show that EVL regulates mechanically directed motility, and that suppression of <italic>EVL</italic> expression impedes 3D durotactic invasion. We propose a model in which EVL-mediated actin polymerization at FAs promotes mechanosensing and durotaxis by maturing, and thus reinforcing, FAs. These findings establish dynamic FA actin polymerization as a central aspect of mechanosensing and identify EVL as a crucial regulator of this process.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="sp1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">R01 CA196885-01</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp2">R01 CA196885-01</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="sp4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Arizona Cancer Center</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/10.13039/100007345</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="sp4">P30CA023074</award-id></award-group><award-group id="sp5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="DOI">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100006536</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="21"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s01"><title>Introduction</title><p>The physical microenvironment regulates many cellular functions, including cell migration (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">van Helvert et al., 2018</xref>). It is established that cell migration can be directed by the rigidity of the microenvironment, in a process known as durotaxis (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lo et al., 2000</xref>). Durotaxis has been implicated in physiological and pathological processes ranging from development (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Flanagan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Sundararaghavan et al., 2009</xref>) to cancer progression (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Levental et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Ulrich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Lachowski et al., 2017</xref>). Durotaxis requires cells to be adept at sensing mechanical stimuli (mechanosensing) and responding to anisotropic mechanical stimulation with directed motility. Although these processes are crucial aspects of durotaxis, the molecular mechanisms that regulate them remain largely unknown.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that cells respond to the mechanical demands of the local microenvironment by dynamically altering their actin cytoskeleton at focal adhesions (FAs; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Choquet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with these findings, mathematical and experimental modeling suggested that the acto-myosin cytoskeleton at FAs mediates an oscillating traction force required for mechanically directed motility, the directional movement toward a mechanical stimulus (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Plotnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanisms that regulate these FA cytoskeletal dynamics and the distinctive role they play in mechanosensing, mechanically directed motility, and durotaxis have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Here, we identified the Ena/VASP family member, Ena/VASP-like (EVL), as a novel regulator of actin polymerization at FAs and found that EVL-mediated actin polymerization regulates cell-matrix adhesion and mechanosensing. We found that EVL plays a crucial role in regulating the mechanically directed motility of normal and cancer cells and, interestingly, that suppression of myosin contractility does not impede this process. Importantly, we found that suppression of <italic>EVL</italic> expression compromises 3D durotactic invasion of cancer cells. Furthermore, we show that response to chemotactic (biochemical) stimulation is enhanced in cells with reduced <italic>EVL</italic> expression, suggesting that EVL uniquely promotes response to mechanical cues. We propose a model in which EVL-mediated FA actin polymerization reinforces FAs during mechanical stimulation, thereby promoting mechanosensing, mechanically directed motility, and durotaxis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s02"><title>Results</title><sec id="s03"><title>Suppression of myosin contractility does not impede mechanically directed motility</title><p>To examine mechanically directed motility, we determined the direction of motility during anisotropic mechanical stimulation of cells at nonleading edges (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Plotnikov et al., 2012</xref>). We measured two directional motility parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 a</xref>): &#x0201c;sensing index&#x0201d; (cosine &#x003b8;), a measurement of the direction of translocation with reference to the stimulation source and starting position; and &#x0201c;turning angles,&#x0201d; a measurement of the change in direction over the course of the stimulation. Control breast cancer MCF7 cells rapidly directed their motility toward the mechanical stimulus, as revealed by positive sensing indices and acute turning angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, b&#x02013;e</xref>). Surprisingly, suppression of myosin contractility, a major component of FA cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Parsons et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>), using Y-27632 did not impede mechanically directed motility on 35-kPa hydrogels, compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, b&#x02013;e</xref>; and Video 1). These data were validated using another myosin inhibitor, Blebbistatin (Fig. S1, a&#x02013;d; and Video 1). Inhibition of myosin contractility was validated by loss of actin bundles and decrease in myosin light chain phosphorylation (Fig. S1 e). To examine whether higher microenvironmental forces required more myosin-mediated contractility, we examined mechanically directed motility on stiffer, 64-kPa hydrogels. Interestingly, on 64-kPa hydrogels, Y-27632 treatment did not impede mechanically directed motility, suggesting that even at a higher stiffness, myosin suppression does not impede this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, f&#x02013;i</xref>; and Video 1). These results suggest that MCF7 cells preserve their capacity to sense mechanical stimulation under myosin suppression.</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mechanically directed motility occurs under myosin suppression.

To determine endogenous expression levels of Ena/VASP proteins, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) for MENA, VASP, and EVL in control MCF7 cells. Relative expression data suggest that while VASP and EVL are expressed to similar degrees in MCF7 cells, MENA is expressed at levels significantly lower than both EVL and VASP (Fig. S2 a).

Compared with control, <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells had significantly reduced cell area on all three substrates, while <italic>MENA</italic> KD and <italic>VASP</italic> KD cells did not (Fig. S2, h&#x02013;j). These results suggest that the reduced cell-matrix adhesion in <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells is associated with compromised cell spreading. Some studies suggest that cell spreading, when restricted, could reciprocally suppress FA maturation (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of <italic>EVL</italic> KD on adhesion while taking into consideration cell spreading as a factor. We examined FA area using regression analysis with cell area as a controlled variable (Fig. S3 a). After controlling for cell area, FA area in <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells was still significantly smaller than in control cells (Fig. S3 b). Additionally, we binned FA measurements by cell area to compare cells of similar spreading area as opposed to a pooled population. In bins of equivalent cell area, FA area in <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells was also significantly smaller than control (Fig. S3, c and d). These analyses suggest that regardless of cell spreading defects, <italic>EVL</italic> KD dramatically suppressed FA area. Moreover, we examined the maturation of individual FAs by measuring their length.

In these cases, mechanical stimulation promotes an increase in FA actin polymerization and induces mechanically directed motility.

To generate a durotactic stimulus, cells are embedded in a soft, central collagen matrix, which is surrounded by an outer collagen matrix rendered stiffer by cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 a</xref>). Importantly, the collagen concentration is held constant between the inner and outer matrices.

Durotaxis requires cells to be capable of (1) sensing a mechanical stimulus (mechanosensing), (2) directing their motility toward the stimulus (mechanically directed motility), and (3) migrating in the direction of the stimulus. Although essential to durotaxis, a mechanistic understanding of these processes has been unclear. Here, we show that EVL promotes actin polymerization at FAs and that EVL-mediated FA actin polymerization regulates cell-matrix adhesion and mechanosensing. We found that EVL is a distinct regulator of mechanically directed motility, and that EVL promotes durotactic invasion. We propose a model in which EVL-mediated FA actin polymerization reinforces FAs and promotes the response to mechanical stimulation.</p><sec id="s10"><title>EVL-mediated actin polymerization at FAs is crucial for cell-matrix adhesion and mechanosensing</title><p>Previous reports have suggested that actin is polymerized at FAs; however, these studies did not identify an actin polymerization factor responsible for this process that localizes to FAs throughout their lifespan (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gupton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Hirata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Iskratsch et al., 2013</xref>). Our data suggest that EVL is responsible for promoting actin polymerization at FAs. Importantly, we show that EVL is specifically required for promoting cell-matrix adhesion in a panel of cancer and normal cell lines. Our results are consistent with previous work showing that Ena/VASP proteins localize to FAs (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Furman et al., 2007</xref>) and regulate actin (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gertler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lambrechts et al., 2000</xref>) and FA dynamics (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Worth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gupton et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we found that expression of MENA or VASP did not restore the reduced-adhesion phenotypes observed in <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells, and through use of chimeric mutants, we found that the EVH1 domain of EVL is unique among Ena/VASP proteins and is specifically required for EVL&#x02019;s function at FAs. These data corroborate mounting evidence that Ena/VASP proteins, once thought to be functionally interchangeable (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Laurent et al., 1999</xref>), have unique and specific roles in regulating FAs. For example, MENA uniquely binds &#x003b1;5 integrin and modulates adhesion signaling through an actin-independent mechanism (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Gupton et al., 2012</xref>), and VASP cooperates with RIAM (rap-1 interacing molecule) and zyxin to regulate &#x003b2;1 integrin dynamics (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Worth et al., 2010</xref>) and stress fiber integrity (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2010</xref>), respectively. Therefore, while our data establish EVL as the primary Ena/VASP protein responsible for actin polymerization&#x02013;mediated cell-matrix adhesion, MENA and VASP provide distinct yet indispensable contributions to FAs.</p><p>In addition, our results suggest that EVL-mediated actin polymerization at FAs is required for mechanosensing. The use of EVL domain deletion mutants corroborates that the ability of EVL to mediate mechanosensing is dependent on its actin polymerization activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that expression of <italic>EVL</italic> is sufficient to promote cell-matrix adhesion and mechanosensory signaling under baseline and myosin suppression conditions. These results are in agreement with previous work suggesting that FA maturation in response to extracellular force is more dependent on actin polymerization and filament integrity than on myosin contractility (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Riveline et al., 2001</xref>), and that an actin template is sufficient for sustaining FA signaling events under myosin inhibition (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Oakes et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that while myosin is a regulator of FA maturation and mechanosensing (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Pasapera et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aguilar-Cuenca et al., 2014</xref>), EVL is sufficient to promote these processes, at least in part, in the presence of low myosin contractility.</p></sec><sec id="s11"><title>EVL regulates mechanically directed motility, while suppression of myosin contractility does not impede this process</title><p>Our data suggest that EVL is a crucial regulator of mechanically directed motility. We demonstrate that <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells display significantly reduced directed motility toward mechanical stimuli, as well as disproportional de-adhesion upon anisotropic mechanical stimulation. Importantly, we show that expression of the actin-deficient mutant &#x00394;GF-PFN-<italic>EVL</italic> was not sufficient to restore mechanically directed motility in <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells. Considering previous works showing that FAs and their associated actin are dynamically remodeled in response to changes in environmental forces (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Choquet et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Elosegui-Artola et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2016</xref>), our results suggest a model in which EVL, via FA actin polymerization, is an integral component of this response. In this model, the requirements for FA actin polymerization shift in relation to mechanical demands, and this polymerization is, at least in part, regulated by <italic>EVL</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 a</xref>). In support of this model, we found that <italic>EVL</italic> KD cells are capable of exhibiting mechanically directed motility on softer, 8-kPa hydrogels. However, it is important to note that mechanical stimulation of cells plated on hydrogels of different stiffness are not directly comparable, as hydrogel stiffness alters both the magnitude of force exerted during stimulation and the baseline FA biology of plated cells. Therefore, future work is necessary to fully characterize the specific relationships between absolute microenvironmental stiffness, force magnitude during mechanical stimulation, and actin polymerization requirements during mechanical response.</p><p>Importantly, Ena/VASP proteins are not the only actin-polymerizing factors regulating FA dynamics in cells; formins are another family of actin-polymerizing proteins shown to affect FA dynamics (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Gupton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Oakes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Iskratsch et al., 2013</xref>). Although our formin-inhibition data suggest that suppression of formin activity does not significantly impede mechanically directed motility, it is possible that remaining levels of formin activity in these cells are sufficient to support their motility. More directed studies are needed to determine if formins collaborate with Ena/VASP, for example, by mediating actin nucleation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Campellone and Welch, 2010</xref>), to contribute to this process.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that suppression of myosin activity does not impede mechanically directed motility. Myosin contractility has been implicated in single-cell (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Raab et al., 2012</xref>) and collective cell durotaxis (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sunyer et al., 2016</xref>), and in cell migration in general (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Vallenius, 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, a distinct role for myosin in the process of sensing directional mechanical stimuli has not been reported. Although it informs long-range migration, the sensing of directional cues can be regulated by distinct molecular processes (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Mouneimne et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Importantly, suppression of myosin contractility did perturb retraction of the cell rear during mechanically directed motility, which is consistent with previous reports (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Sunyer et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, myosin may be dispensable in directing cells toward a mechanical stimulus (mechanically directed motility), while still being crucial for long-range migration toward increasing stiffness (durotaxis). Due to these complexities, future work is needed to fully characterize the specific role of myosin during each of these diverse mechanically regulated functions.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>EVL specifically promotes durotactic invasion</title><p>Our data suggest that EVL promotes durotactic invasion into 3D matrix; this is consistent with its essential role in mechanosensing and mechanically directed motility and highlights the significance of these processes for durotactic invasion.

These data emphasize a role for EVL in specifically mediating a response to mechanical stimulation, as opposed to promoting migration and invasion in general. Additionally, microenvironmental factors that guide cell migration are not limited to mechanical cues; cell migration can also be guided by biochemical gradients as in chemotaxis (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Roussos et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that, unlike mechanically directed motility, EVL is suppressive to chemo-directed motility.

Combined with our findings, these studies suggest that Ena/VASP proteins play divergent roles in directed cell migration and invasion. Importantly, these proteins could potentially play a significant role in integrating biochemical and mechanical signals from the cell microenvironment to guide migration in physiological and pathological contexts. While future studies will be required to address the complexity of chemical and mechanical signal integration during migration, mechanistic studies on the role of Ena/VASP proteins in signal sensing provide a valuable foundation to this emerging field.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s13"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s14"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF7, U2OS, NIH-3T3, and HEK293T cells were grown in high-glucose DMEM (Corning), supplemented with 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Corning), 10% FBS (Gibco), and 100 U/ml penicillin with 100 &#x000b5;g/ml streptomycin (Corning).

Before imaging, imaging buffer was added to cells (full medium supplemented with 10 mM Hepes). A micromanipulator (InjectMan NI2; Eppendorf) was fitted with a glass micropipette (Femtotip; Eppendorf), which was loaded with 10 nM IGF with 3-kD fluorescently labeled Dextran clarified by 0.2-&#x000b5;m filters. A chemotactic gradient was generated using a pressure-regulated microinjection system at 25pi with continuous flow (FemtoJet; Eppendorf). Micropipettes were placed &#x0223c;25 &#x000b5;m away from nonleading edges of single cells, and IGF was released from the micropipette for 2 min. Experiments were imaged on a Ti-E inverted microscope, with a 60&#x000d7; Plan Apo 1.40 NA objective, and an ORCA-Flash 4.0 V2 CMOS camera, a motorized stage, and an environmental chamber. Imaging was done at 37&#x000b0;C with ambient 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Stimulated cells were imaged by DIC microscopy at a 1-s frame rate for 30 min. Wide-field fluorescence, captured at a 1-min frame rate, was used to visualize the chemotactic gradient. Chemotactic sensing was quantified using the sensing index and turning angles of manual traces done in ImageJ (see Sensing index and turning angles).</p></sec><sec id="s34"><title>Sensing index and turning angles</title><sec id="s35"><title>Sensing index</title><p>Cosine &#x003b8; was quantified as previously described (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Mouneimne et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, &#x003b8; was measured as the angle between the pipette, the first centroid position of the cell, and each subsequent centroid position of the cell at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min. Sensing indices range from +1 to &#x02212;1, with +1 representing the highest level of directionality toward the stimulus and &#x02212;1 representing the highest level of directionality away from the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s36"><title>Turning angles</title><p>Turning angles were measured between the pipette, the current centroid position of the cell, and subsequent centroid positions of the cell at 5-min intervals. Angles were then adjusted for plotting on a normalized polar graph by converting the cell centroid position at time 0, to <italic>x</italic> = 0, <italic>y</italic> = 0, and transforming all cell centroid positions with reference to cell centroid position at time 0. Centroid positions were then rotationally transformed so that pipette positions were set along the same axis. For plotting, rose plots were divided into 30&#x000b0; sectors, and turning angles from all time points were plotted as a population percentage, with each step within sectors representing 1% of all turns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s37"><title>3D invasion assays</title><p>Invasion assays were modified from <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Padilla-Rodriguez et al. (2018)</xref>. Chambered 1.5 coverglass (Lab-Tek) was treated with silane and glutaraldehyde (see Preparation of deformable hydrogels) and sterilized under UV light for 15 min. Cells were suspended in 1 mg/ml type I collagen (Corning) diluted in DMEM (Corning), containing 0.0625 mg/ml ethylene glycol-bis (succinic acid <italic>N</italic>-hydroxysuccinimide ester; MP Biomedicals), buffered to a neutral pH with sodium hydroxide. The cell/collagen solution was then plated as a 3D dome in the center of the treated coverglass and allowed to polymerize at 37&#x000b0;C. For durotactic invasion assays, the outer collagen matrix was prepared by combining 1 mg/ml type I collagen in DMEM with 0.625 mg/ml ethylene glycol-bis and buffering the solution to a neutral pH with sodium hydroxide. The outer collagen for soft invasion assays was prepared by combining 1 mg/ml type I collagen diluted in DMEM containing 0.0625 mg/ml ethylene glycol-bis and 20 nM IGF (Sigma-Aldrich), buffered to a neutral pH with sodium hydroxide. After cell/collagen polymerization, the outer collagen matrix solution was added onto the cell/collagen matrix and allowed to polymerize at 37&#x000b0;C. After polymerization, collagen gels were covered with medium. MCF7 invasion assays were performed for 4 d with medium changes every 24 h, and U2OS invasion assays were performed for 18 h with imaging beginning immediately after plating. MCF7 invasion assays were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 24 h at 4&#x000b0;C, and large stitch imaging of wide-field fluorescence and DIC microscopy was used for imaging the entire cell/matrix boundary. U2OS invasion assays were imaged using multipoint DIC microscopy for 18 h at a 10-min frame rate, with a 5-&#x000b5;m step z-series. All invasion assays were imaged on a Ti-E inverted microscope, with a 20&#x000d7; Plan Apo 0.75 NA objective, an ORCA-Flash 4.0 V2 CMOS camera, and a motorized stage. Invasion assays were quantified by counting the number of cells invaded into the outer matrix in Elements software; cells were counted as invaded once their nucleus crossed the inner/outer matrix boundary.</p></sec><sec id="s38"><title>Atomic force microscope&#x02013;based nano-indentation</title><p>A commercial atomic force microscope (MFP-3D-BIO AFM, Asylum Research) was used for the determination of the elastic moduli (i.e., stiffness) as previously described (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Staunton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, spheroconical probes (LRCH, Team Nanotech) with nominal spring constants of 0.2 N &#x022c5; m<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, a half cone angle of 18.8&#x000b0;, tip length of &#x0003e;10 &#x000b5;m, and a spherical radius of 700 nm were used to collect force&#x02013;indentation curves in four to seven 4 &#x000d7; 5 grids of 90 &#x000d7; 90-&#x000b5;m areas at 37&#x000b0;C in PBS buffer with an indenter vertical speed of 2 &#x000b5;m &#x022c5; s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Trigger forces of 20&#x02013;30 nN resulted in indentation depths &#x02265;10 &#x000b5;m. The elastic moduli were obtained by fitting the initial 10 &#x000b5;m of indentation of each force&#x02013;indentation curve to a nonadhesive elastic contact model for spheroconical probes (<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Staunton et al., 2016</xref>). Collagen was assumed to be incompressible, with a Poisson ratio of 0.5 (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Lacroix et al., 2018</xref>). The spring constants of the cantilevers were determined by the thermal noise method before the experiment (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Butt and Manfred, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s39"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 8 and Stata 15. For the analysis of FA area in the different cell area bins, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used. For the multiple regression analysis of FA area as a dependent variable, experiment and cell area were used as independent variables and controlled for; data were log-transformed to accomplish normality for this analysis. For analysis of mechanically directed motility, statistical differences were determined by a two-way ANOVA, using the raw angle data after square root transformation; P values are specified in figures and figure legends. For analysis of 3D invasion, data were transformed to denote fold-change from the condition with highest values, and one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests were performed with a hypothetical value of 1. For de-adhesion event data, statistical differences were determined using a Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. For qPCR and zymogram data, statistical differences were determined using a two-tailed Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test. For all other data, statistical differences were determined using regression analysis to control for variability between experiments, and non&#x02013;normally distributed data were transformed using log or square root to achieve normality (untransformed data are graphed for clarity). Exact P values between all comparisons are plotted in Tables S2 and S3. Sample sizes and number of repeated experiments are specified in the legends. Data are presented as violin plots with median, dot plots with mean &#x000b1; SEM, or dot plots with mean &#x000b1; SD, as denoted in figure legends.

Fig. S2 shows that EVL is required for cell-matrix adhesion and cell spreading. Fig. S3 shows that EVL KD reduces FA area independently of cell spreading. Fig. S4 shows that EVL KD reduces FA maturation and mechanosensory signaling, and that EVL localizes with sites of actin polymerization at FAs. Fig. S5 shows measurements of cell area in mechanically directed motility assays and the suppression of mechanically directed motility by reduced EVL expression. Fig. S6 shows that EVL KD uniquely impairs directionality, but not random migration speed of cells or MMP activity.
