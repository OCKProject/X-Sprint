Herein, we aimed to elucidate the bioactive compounds of GLE responsible for this anti-cancer activity. We performed NMR, X-ray crystallography and analog derivatization as well as anti-cancer activity studies to elucidate and test the compounds. We report the structures of the seven most abundant GLE compounds and their selective efficacy against triple negative (TNBC) and inflammatory breast cancers (IBC) and other human cancer cell types (solid and blood malignancies) to illustrate their potential as anti-cancer agents. Three of the seven compounds (ergosterol, 5,6-dehydroergosterol and ergosterol peroxide) exhibited significant <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-cancer activities, while we report for the first time the structure elucidation of 5,6-dehydroergosterol from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>. We also show for the first time in TNBC/IBC cells that ergosterol peroxide (EP) displays anti-proliferative effects through G1 phase cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction via caspase 3/7 activation, and PARP cleavage. EP decreased migratory and invasive effects of cancer cells while inhibiting the expression of total AKT1, AKT2, BCL-XL, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc in the tested IBC cells. Our investigation also indicates that these compounds induce reactive oxygen species, compromising cell fate. Furthermore, we generated a superior derivative, ergosterol peroxide sulfonamide, with improved potency in IBC cells and ample therapeutic index (TI &#x0003e; 10) compared to normal cells. The combined studies indicate that EP from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> extract is a promising molecular scaffold for further exploration as an anti-cancer agent.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic></kwd><kwd>ergosterol peroxide</kwd><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>EP derivatives</kwd><kwd>natural product</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institute of General Medical Sciences<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000057</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">GM111171</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">MD007583</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn003">U.S. Department of Education<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000138</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn003">P031S130068</award-id><award-id rid="cn003">P031M105050</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn004">Puerto Rico Science, Technology and Research Trust<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100008902</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn004">2017-00143</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn005">American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100012524</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="10"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="64"/><page-count count="17"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Increased toxic effects from conventional therapies, as well as evidence from recent reports that prove the efficacy of natural therapies, have caused a rise in their use by patients with cancer (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Su&#x000e1;rez-Arroyo et al., 2017</xref>). Among these therapies is the whole medicinal mushroom <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than two millennia (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Paterson, 2006</xref>). Patients with cancer who take <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> extract (GLE) display improved quality of life and prolonged lives without interference with their conventional therapy (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). The most common uses for commercially available GLE include prevention and treatment of hypertension, cancer, and immunological disorders (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Although the fruiting body of <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> has been used as a traditional medicine for decades, the spores have also become a research subject more recently (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Min et al., 2000</xref>). The spores contain mainly lanostane-type triterpenes (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2006</xref>) and polysaccharides (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Huie and Di, 2004</xref>) similar to those found in the fruiting body, which are the main chemical compounds to which anti-cancer activities of GLE are attributed.</p><p>Mechanisms of cancer prevention by GLE have been summarized in several reports (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Jong and Donovick, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wasser and Weis, 1999</xref>). We have reported that commercially available whole mushroom GLE selectively inhibits breast cancer cell viability and in various models of human cancer induces apoptosis, reduces invasion, and regulates key signaling molecules (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Montemayor et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, we have also shown that GLE reduces tumor volume in mice by &#x0223c;50% when administered alone (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Suarez-Arroyo et al., 2013</xref>) or in combination with conventional therapy (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Suarez-Arroyo et al., 2016</xref>) in mice xenografts. Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the chemical constituents of GLE responsible for its biological activity and characterize their efficacy as single agents in various cancer cell models, particularly in inflammatory breast cancer. Herein we describe the structure elucidation of the 7 most abundant chemical components of GLE (whole mushroom ReishiMax) by NMR studies, X-ray crystallography and analog derivatization. Our work demonstrates the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy of these compounds, which include triterpenes, and sterols, in various cancer models. To overcome poor solubility properties, we synthesized improved derivatives, which display superior potency against aggressive models of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental Chemistry Procedures</title><sec><title>General Information</title><p>Capsules (500 mg) of commercially available whole mushroom ReishiMax GLp<sup>TM</sup> (Pharmanex Inc., Provo, UT, United States), consisting of powdered <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> extract (GLE) fruiting body and cracked spores were used (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Montemayor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Suarez-Arroyo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether (Et<sub>2</sub>O), dichloromethane (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), toluene (PhCH<sub>3</sub>), acetonitrile (CH<sub>3</sub>CN), methanol (MEOH), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were obtained from a solvent drying system. Reagents of the highest available quality were purchased commercially and used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Title compounds were purified by flash column chromatography using E. Merck silica gel (60, particle size 0.040&#x02013;0.063 mmol) or Biotage Isolera Four with normal-phase silica gel. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on 0.25 mmol E. Merck silica gel plates (60F-254), using UV light for visualization and an ethanolic solution of anisaldehyde, or PMA, CAM solutions and heat as developing agents. Reactions were also monitored by using Agilent 1100 series LCMS and low-resonance electrospray ionization (ESI) model with UV detection at 254 nm. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR that were recorded on 400/or 500 MHz Bruker AVANCE III HD NMR (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figures S9&#x02013;S17</xref>).

Data are reported as follows: chemical shifts, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, quint = quintet, m = multiplet, br = broad), coupling constant (Hz), and integration. Data were processed by using MestReNova. Optical rotations were measured on a DCIF polarimeter (JASCO P-1010) using a 2-mL cell with a 100-mm path length. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on an Agilent ESI-TOF (time of flight) mass spectrometer using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) or electrospray ionization (ESI) or on a Waters Xevo G2 Q-ToF mass spectrometer. Compounds were analyzed by using ESI in positive-ion mode. The purity of each synthesized compound was determined on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS system using a C<sub>18</sub> reverse phase column and 0.1% formic acid/water &#x02013; 0.1% formic acid/acetonitrile as the solvents. All synthesized compounds were at least 95% pure based on analytical HPLC and NMR.

Furthermore, we assessed the possibility of the endoperoxide motif to react with NAC, thus EP was incubated with NAC in DMSO for 24 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The reaction mixture was monitored by NMR and LC-MS and no observable olefin migration or opening of the endoperoxide was detected. Thus, the ability of EP to induce ROS could potentially be via a different mechanism from that of TBHP in MCF-7 cells.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7</label><caption><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in MDA-MB-231 and SUM-149 cells. <bold>(A)</bold> MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells or <bold>(B)</bold> SUM-149 breast cancer cells were treated as described in the Section &#x0201c;Materials and Methods&#x0201d; with EP (20 &#x003bc;M), or menadione (10 &#x003bc;M) as a positive control. <italic>N</italic>-Acetyl Cysteine (500 &#x003bc;M) was added to inhibit ROS formation.

We reasoned that the observed modest bioactivity of these compounds was partially due to compound solubility or membrane-permeability. Therefore, introduction of a carbamate functional group as a prodrug strategy should improve cellular activity. The synthesis of these derivatives is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), which included the addition of benzenesulfonyl chloride (1.1 equiv.) to ergosterol (compound 4a, ergosterol sulfonamide), 5,6-dehydroergosterol (compound 5a, 5,6-dehydroergosterol sulfonamide), and EP (compound 6a, ergosterol peroxide sulfonamide) in THF at RT. The reaction was completed in good to excellent yields (87&#x02013;93%). Weakly basic compounds can exist in the un-ionized or ionized form, depending on the pH of their environment and the pKa of the functional groups (-OH, -CO<sub>2</sub>H). It is frequently understood that ionized compounds have reduced permeability across lipid bilayers relative to that of un-ionized compounds. The neutral carbamate derivatives ergosterol sulfonamide, 5,6-dehydroergosterol sulfonamide, and EP sulfonamide should have improved solubility and cross the cell membrane, resulting in a favorable, slow intracellular accumulation.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>FIGURE 9</label><caption><p>Chemical transformations of GA-01, ergosterol, 5, 6-dihydroergosterol and ergosterol peroxide to GA-01-ME (compound 1a), ergosterol sulfonamide (compound 4a), 5, 6-dihydroergosterol sulfonamide (compound 5a), and ergosterol peroxide sulfonamide (compound 6a).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fphar-10-00115-g009"/></fig><p>The cytotoxicity evaluation of the compounds in breast cancer cells showed improved cytotoxicity effects over those of their corresponding parental structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10A</xref>).

Triterpene content variations can occur due to differences in terpene production by mushroom or extraction methods. Herein, we present the seven most abundant compounds in GLE, which included ganoderic acid (GA-01), ganoderenic acid A, ganoderenic acid D, ergosterol, 5,6-dehydroergosterol, ergosterol peroxide (EP), and palmitic acid. Although previous crystal structures of ergosterol have been reported, in our current study we provide for the first time the X-ray structure of 5,6-dehydroergosterol from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>.</p><p>To capture potential differences in the pathobiology of cancer, we tested the effects of the isolated compounds in a representative panel of breast cancer cellular models. MDA-MB-231 and SUM-149 are triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells that is, they lack the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and represent two distinct breast cancer subtypes: mesenchymal-like breast cancer (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2011</xref>) and epithelial-like inflammatory breast cancer (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), respectively. SUM-190 is an IBC cell line that is ER/PR-negative but expresses the HER2 oncogene (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Robertson et al., 2012</xref>); and MCF-7 cells express ER/PR receptors (ER/PR-positive/HER2-negative) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Brandes and Hermonat, 1983</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Siddiqa et al., 2008</xref>). We focused our investigation on testing the compounds against the most aggressive breast cancer models (TNBC and IBC) because there is a lack of therapeutic agents for successful treatment in this patient cohort (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Cristofanilli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Silvera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Out of the seven isolated compounds, we show that ergosterol displayed modest biological activity against SUM-149 cells in agreement with previous ergosterol studies in HEPG2, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bu et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, EP displayed the greatest selective anti-cancer activity in the cell lines tested. EP features a cyclic peroxide (-O-O-), and these compounds are collectively known as endoperoxides. A classic example of this class of compounds is featured in the antimalarial drug, artemisinin, which has aid in reducing the widespread of drug-resistant parasites and has demonstrated cytotoxic activity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Posner et al., 2004</xref>). EP has been shown to have anti-cancer cell growth properties via regulation of various signaling pathways (e.g., AKT and c-myc) in a hepatocellular carcinoma cell model (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Similarly, our results show that EP selectively affects cancer cell viability in various cancer models, where SUM-149 IBC cells display the highest sensitivity. Interestingly, EP treatment in normal BJ and non-cancerous mammary epithelial MCF10A cells did not show significant cytotoxicity. Our studies revealed that EP induces G1 arrest in the cell cycle, which is accompanied with a decrease in cyclin D1 and c-myc expression and an increase in early apoptosis of SUM-149 cells. Comparable regulatory results were obtained in colorectal and hepatocellular cancer cell models upon EP treatment, with most cells stalled in the early stages of the cycle (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, we show that EP reduces the expression of pro-survival p-AKT1, as well as levels of total AKT1 and AKT2 without affecting p-AKT2. It is possible that EP decreases total AKT2 without affecting p-AKT2 via a feedback mechanism, which induces signals to overcome the inhibitory effects obtained on total protein. Although p-AKT2 is not significantly upregulated, the phosphorylated levels might be stabilized to compensate for loss of total AKT2. Further studies are underway to understand the cell signaling regulatory effects of EP.</p><p>Interestingly, EP treatment of SUM-149 cells reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis detected by an increase in caspase-3/7 activity and PARP cleavage after 24 h of treatment. EP&#x02019;s cytotoxicity profile in SUM-149 (TNBC/IBC) cells is consistent with that of cells exposed to a compound that induces cell-cycle arrest and early-phase apoptosis (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hook and Schagat, 2012</xref>). In contrast, we show that EP decreased cancer cell viability, while induced apoptosis via caspase 3/7 activation, and increased cytotoxicity of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. The combined results suggest the death-inducing effects of EP on the two TNBC cell lines occurs by different mechanisms, which we are currently studying. All the tested compounds induce ROS in breast cancer cells albeit at different levels. Specifically, EP increases ROS formation with greater capacity in SUM-149 cells, and the effects where reduced when co-treated with NAC. Therefore, intracellular ROS might be an additional contributing factor for the observed apoptotic effects of EP. Importantly, our results are consistent with the apoptosis-inducing effects of EP that have been previously obtained from distinct sources and demonstrated in various <italic>in vitro</italic> cancer models, including colorectal, prostate, and leukemia cells (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Takei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kobori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Russo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Additional cancer cell properties that increase their pathogenicity include their ability to migrate and invade to distant organ sites. Thus, we investigated the regulatory effects of non-lethal doses of EP on SUM-149 cell motility and invasion. We show that EP displayed a reduction in cell migration and invasion, and these results are consistent with our previous studies with GLE wherein we demonstrated reduced invasion potential of breast cancer cells (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Montemayor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Suarez-Arroyo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Su&#x000e1;rez-Arroyo et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, our results presented in this study are the first to demonstrate the anti-migratory effects of EP in SUM-149 breast cancer cells, and we demonstrate anti-invasion effects at lower dosages than those reported in the literature in breast cancer lines (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>One of the liabilities with EP is sharing its core with cholesterol, an amphipathic molecule with part-water soluble, part-water insoluble character. Thus, while able to readily cross the cell membrane, the ability to deliver the pure compound faces challenges. EP&#x02019;s solubility properties are poor in DMSO or water unless warmed up to 30&#x000b0;C. However, in this study, we showed that EP&#x02019;s derivative, EP sulfonamide, was soluble at 10 mM in DMSO. Thus, we successfully demonstrate the generation of a selective anti-cancer compound with greater potency than EP, and ample therapeutic window when compared to BJ normal cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study details the structure elucidation of the most abundant chemical constituents of whole mushroom <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> and their efficacy in cancer models, particularly in triple negative inflammatory breast cancer. The isolated compounds of GLE, display biological activity across multiple cancer cell lines, with several degrees of potency. This investigation demonstrates for the first time (i) that EP as a single component of GLE, is the most biologically active compound against aggressive inflammatory breast cancer models with promising EC<sub>50</sub> values in the low micromolar range and ample therapeutic index in normal cells. (ii) A detailed report of the X-ray crystal of 5,6-dehydroergosterol from <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>; and (iii) that we developed improved derivatives of GA-01, ergosterol, 5,6-dehydroergosterol and EP by addressing their solubility. We also show that unlike many natural products, GA-01 and EP, do not act on proliferation by inhibiting protein synthesis. However, we show that cell death is mediated by caspase activation through the modulation of cancer dependent mechanisms (e.g., AKT pro-survival pathway). Our data indicates that GA-01, ergosterol, 5,6-dehydroergosterol and EP induced ROS in breast cancer cell models, suggesting that ROS mediated-mechanisms contribute in the onset of cell death signaling pathways. To better understand the cascade of signaling events we also demonstrate that EP modulates AKT, with subsequent reduction of proteins involved in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and progression (e.g., Cyclin D1, c-Myc). Finally, we have developed more potent compounds, such as EP sulfonamide, for further molecular mechanistic studies to understand the mode of action of these compounds in preclinical models.</p></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>MM-M and FR designed and performed the research, collected data, analyzed and interpreted data, performed statistical analysis, and wrote the manuscript.
