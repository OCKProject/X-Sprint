Characterizing the state and direction of progress in this arena is challenging but important. Here, we employ three metrics: a classical metric of productivity (publications per person), an adapted metric which we denote as Revealed Scientific Advantage (developed from work used to compare publications in scientific fields among countries) to characterize disciplinary specialty, and a new metric, scientific indigeneity (defined as the ratio of publications with domestic corresponding authors) to characterize the locus of scientific activity that also serves as a partial proxy for local absorptive capacity. These metrics&#x02014;using population and publications data that are available for most countries&#x02013;allow the characterization of some key features of national scientific enterprise. The trends in productivity and indigeneity when compared across other countries and regions can serve as indicators of strength or fragility in the national research ecosystems, and the trends in specialty can allow regional policy makers to assess the extent to which the areas of focus of research align (or not align) with regional priorities. We apply the metrics to study the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)&#x02014;a region where science and technology capacity will play a key role in national economic diversification. We analyze 9.8 million publication records between 1981&#x02013;2013 in 17 countries of MENA from Morocco to Iraq and compare it to selected countries throughout the world. The results show that international collaborators increasingly drove the scientific activity in MENA. The median indigeneity reached 52% in 2013 (indicating that almost half of the corresponding authors were located in foreign countries). Additionally, the regional disciplinary focus in chemical and petroleum engineering is waning with modest growth in the life sciences. We find repeated patterns of stagnation and contraction of scientific activity for several MENA countries contributing to a widening productivity gap on an international comparative yardstick. The results prompt questions about the strength of the developing scientific enterprise and highlight the need for consistent long-term policy for effectively addressing regional challenges with domestic research.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Kuwait Program at Harvard Kennedy School</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from the Kuwait Program at Harvard Kennedy School.

Several developing countries are seeking to advance national capabilities in research and innovation, with the ultimate aim of fostering economic diversification and growth. Many experts studying the role of scientific research and technological innovation in broader national development note that countries need an initial (threshold) level of scientific and technological capabilities (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. absorptive capacity) in order to reap the full value of external information, and technology flows [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some developing countries seek to advance local infrastructure, education, health, and other important sectors, by importing modern technologies; but for successful adoption, implementation, and use of such technologies, these countries need to have a certain level of internal (domestic) technical ability and capacity for creating new knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Policy makers in several countries, including countries in South East Asia, Middle East, and Africa, have been seeking a transition to the so-called <italic>knowledge-based economies</italic> (OECD, 1996) for the past few decades. For countries that have made efforts to promote domestic research and innovation capacity and economic diversification&#x02014;through investments in science and technology capacity&#x02014;a study of how their national scientific enterprise has evolved can help design future policy initiatives. The results can further inform global understanding of and challenges in scientific development in the 21<sup>st</sup> century&#x02013;an era of increased globalization marked with an ever-quickening pace of scientific activities and output.</p><p>One difficulty in characterizing the state and direction of progress in the scientific arena for countries that had historically low levels of scientific research is lack of detailed data. Some countries, including OECD nations and a subset of other countries, have put in place systems for collecting, compiling, and publishing detailed data about their research enterprise, including national assessment reports regarding the state of research. Many countries in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere, however, do not yet have readily accessible, verifiable, and comparable data sources. In some cases, data on investments is being made available (such as through the World Bank&#x02019;s Data Bank), however complete historical time-series data is rare. These limitations make it difficult to use metrics of input and efficiency (that use ratios of R&#x00026;D investments and patents and citations) to gauge national performance in science and technology [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] over time.</p><p>Here, we use three quantitative metrics: (a) a classical metric of productivity (publications per person) first used by Lotka in 1926, (b) an adapted metric which we denote as Revealed Scientific Advantage, to compare publications in scientific disciplines among countries, and (c) a new metric, scientific indigeneity (defined as the ratio of publications with domestic corresponding authors), to characterize the locus of scientific activity that may also serve as a partial indicator for local absorptive capacity.</p><p>These metrics, which rely on population and publications data that are available for most countries over time, allow the characterization of some key features of trends in national scientific enterprise. The temporal productivity and indigeneity when compared across other countries and regions can serve as indicators of strength or fragility in the national research ecosystems, and the trends in specialty can allow regional policy makers to assess the extent to which the areas of focus of research align (or not align) with regional priorities.</p><p>We apply the metrics to study the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Several countries in the region&#x02013;facing mounting socio-economic challenges with rapidly increasing populations and declining oil reserves&#x02014;are seeking to advance their research and innovation capabilities [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Egypt launched the Decade for Science and Technology 2007&#x02013;16 to strengthen national science and technology. The oil-dependent economies of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have poured billions of dollars since the late 1990s in establishing new universities, creating technology parks, and actively recruiting top researchers around the globe to relocate to the region, as part of efforts for future economic diversification and expansion (Sections A and B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>Current data shows that the number of annual scientific publications in the region has risen (Figure A in Section B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). However, there is a lack of knowledge about how the regional trends compare in an international context and what if any insights maybe useful for the global scientific community. Here we analyze three interconnected questions utilizing newly available data and new indicators: 1) How has national research productivity evolved in MENA and how does it compare with other countries? 2) What has been the contribution of international collaborations on stimulating regional scientific output? 3) What are the areas of disciplinary focus and how do they compare globally?</p><p>We investigate these questions of productivity, geography, and disciplinary focus in scientific activities in 17 countries of the MENA region (Morocco, Libya, Algeria, Tunisia, Sudan, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, and Iraq) between 1981 and 2013 using publications as a partial indicator of scientific output and conducting an empirical analysis of over 9.84 million records sourced from the Science Citation Index-Expanded. The quantitative long time-series analysis&#x02013;which has not been previously conducted for the region or for comparison purposes&#x02014;allowed for characterizing the emergent trends. Additionally, we compared the MENA region with a group of seven carefully selected countries: Turkey (a newly industrializing and emerging economy, geographically and historically connected with MENA), Norway (an industrialized, European welfare economy with extensive North Sea oil reserves), South Korea (an industrialized East Asian economy with consistently one of the highest economic growth rates), Singapore (a trade-oriented economy with strong focus on education and research), Australia (one of the top 20 economies with extensive mining and agricultural sectors), and China (a new global power in manufacturing with increasing scientific research). We also included the US to provide comparison with the globally dominant scientific enterprise.</p><p>While the outputs of scientific activities go beyond published papers, bibliometric analysis nevertheless allows for comparisons and quantitative measurements of the system that are traceable over time. The issue of quality of the research output is critical and is an important part of assessing national scientific impact [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, here we focus on quantity noting that for countries that are trying to ramp up their research system, the quantity of peer-reviewed scientific publications in English provides a useful metric of progress given the very recent and major efforts to expand in this area. Citations have their own limitations [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, the Web of Science citation data does not capture all the relevant citations for decision makers in the region, which include policy documents and reports.</p><p>Our quantitative analysis was directed and the results were interpreted in light of over 80 semi-structured interviews that we conducted with faculty, senior administrators (including university presidents and college deans) and technology firm executives during field visits to Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and UAE from 2013&#x02013;2015 (Section A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). Our on-site discussions with researchers in the region serve as an important distinguishing factor of this work and informed both our selection and development of quantitative indicators and the interpretation of the quantitative results.</p><p>In the following sections we provide a description of the data collection method, a definition and discussion of the metrics we used in this work, and a discussion of key trends at national and regional level that emerge from our analysis along with implications for policy and further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We obtained publications data from the Science Citation Index-Expanded through the Web of Science<sup>TM</sup> Core Collection (Section A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). The search queries were performed during 2014 through 2015, therefore due to the consistent growth of journals indexed in the database, it is likely that there may be some differences in exact publication counts for queries executed at a later time. The focus of our work was on analyzing total scientific publications in nations that have not had significant research activities in the recent past. Therefore, we chose the Science Citation Index-Expanded (rather than the more widely used Science Citation Index) since it has wider coverage (although of varying journal quality). We included full journal articles (see Table C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>) only and did not account for letters, reviews, conference papers, books or other publications.

We conducted this search for 175 areas that we determined to be relevant leaving out areas from social sciences (such as economics and business management). The subject areas were consolidated into 15 categories (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>) based on results reported in [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], wherein a systematic decomposition of a journal-journal citation matrix was used to identify inter-connected disciplines.

It has been shown that while simple knowledge diffuses equally to close and distant actors, socially proximate recipients have the greatest advantage over distant actors for knowledge of moderate complexity [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and co-location is also important for firm to university collaborations [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Trends in scientific research teams [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and international collaboration patterns have been investigated extensively, with results showing a growing fraction of scientific research being undertaken by teams of collaborators across different universities [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and from multiple countries [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This research did not investigate differences that may arise by country.</p><p>In recognition of the globalization trends, and with the aim of getting insights relevant for domestic capacity development (a question that arose from our interviews), we posed a question of indigeneity&#x02013;<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. how much research is driven by domestic (resident) scientists in a country. Our basis of measuring research activities is publications data, and we make an assumption that <italic>corresponding authors</italic> play a key role in the work reported in a paper. Furthermore, the presence of these researchers in a location will impact effective knowledge transfer, training, mentorship and other activities leading to long-term capacity development. The corresponding author is often fully knowledgeable about the work that is presented in the paper and manages the paper through the peer-review process. She may be the researcher who has done the primary work, or is the senior researcher who has been a central part of the work. Our choice of corresponding author allows for striking a balance in the issue of first and last author contributions, where in some fields, the first author represents the researcher who has done the primary work, whereas in some cases the last author is the main driver of the research.</p><p>We compute the indigeneity, &#x003bb;<sub>i</sub> of country <italic>i</italic>&#x02019;s scientific publications, as:

It is likely that countries that export high percentages of their educated elites would appear to have less successful educational institutions than those with a less important intellectual diaspora. The metric developed here partially captures the level of domestic scientific capacity and also includes the returning diaspora. It, however, precludes the assessment of export of scientific wealth to other countries as a result of migration out of MENA countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Scientific Specialty&#x02013;Revealed Scientific Advantage</title><p>The disciplinary focus&#x02013;or specialization in specific scientific fields&#x02013;is an important characteristic frequently used in assessments of national research [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Such characterization is particularly useful in international comparisons where countries with small total shares in global publications may have larger shares in specific areas. In past research, it has been found that emerging countries often show sharp patterns of specialization (with prominent focus in a few fields) whereas scientifically strong as well as scientifically weak countries may show no particular pattern [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we employ the concept of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)&#x02014;used for determining national trade advantage compared to global exports- in the new context of knowledge economies and apply the definition of RCA on publications (Section A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). The RCA of publications in different scientific fields has been assessed previously [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and relative measures for citations are also used that normalize for country size and global activity [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Here we denote the RCA for publications as Revealed Scientific Advantage (RSA), and define it as the ratio of the fraction of publications in a subject within a country&#x02019;s total publications to the fraction of publications in that subject in world total publications. It thus allows for assessing the disciplinary focus of research output of a country while accounting for global trends in research in particular fields. A country with an RSA&#x0003e;1 in a subject area has more publications than the expectation, while an RSA &#x0003c; 1 in a subject indicates publications less than the global level in that area.</p><p>An advantage in publications is not a sufficient condition for building strategic capacity, and accounting for quantity of publications is a partial measure at best for gauging strength in research. However, an examination of relative research foci in a country can provide useful information for understanding national trends. Given that research outputs are to some extent organic (and not fully controlled by policy), decision makers and administrators of national science and education agencies can utilize this metric to identify strategic areas for growth.</p><p>In our analysis, we agglomerated 175 scientific fields (associated with publications in the Science Citation Index) into 15 disciplines (Table A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>) and evaluated the RSA values in 5-year intervals (Section E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>).

improved for a few years, after which there were two decades of stagnation and decline. A turning point arrived in 2007 when the number of publications started to increase sharply, a time that coincides with large investments in higher education. The global share of Saudi publications climbed from 0.13% in 2006 to 0.54% in 2013. This rapid increase has garnered attention and debate. A number of experts in our semi-structured interviews noted specific policy measures, new programs for higher education and research, and programs for incentivizing faculty to increase publications as the drivers for this growth (Section A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). However, some also pointed out the difficulty in clearly gauging the development of local scientific base in the country with publications data given the extensive non-resident, visiting-affiliations for international researchers in recent years (Section B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). This insight inspired our development of the indigeneity measure for a better assessment of the local knowledge base in countries aiming to develop scientific research capacity.</p><p>In Egypt, with a global share of 0.33% in 1981 (the largest share for any single MENA country at the time), there was little growth and mostly stagnation till 2005. The trajectory turned upwards around 2007 in part due to the launching of a ten-year (2007&#x02013;16) scientific research development plan along with several joint cooperation programs in science and technology with the European Union, Japan, Germany, India, and other countries (Section A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). There was steady growth until 2011 (coinciding with the Egyptian revolution) after which the rate of increase has slowed (Figure D in Section C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>When compared along an international yardstick, the shares for the comparison group of seven countries ranged from 19.2% for US to 0.6% for Norway in 2013 (Figure B in Section B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). The total global share of Egypt (largest MENA country with population of 82 million) at 0.48% was lower than the share of Norway (smallest country in our comparison group with population of 5 million) at 0.6%. The productivity results (publications normalized by population) show that in spite of some gains made in terms of total publications, a wide gap has opened up between the productivity of MENA region and some countries in the comparison group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The median productivity in MENA increased by 10.6% on average per year between 1981 and 2013 changing from 11 to 111 publications per million people (with Qatar achieving the highest regional level of 377 papers per million in 2013) (Figure B in Section B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). In the comparison group, on the other hand, South Korea had an average annual productivity growth rate of 24.7% (from 6 to 968 papers per million), Turkey 18.7% (from 6 to 312 papers per million), and Singapore 16.3% (from 59 to 1913 papers per million) during the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Overall countries in the comparison group progressed faster thereby increasing the productivity gap with MENA region.</p><fig id="pone.0164500.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0164500.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Median productivity (publications/population) in MENA countries (solid red line) shows an enlarged gap in comparison to Singapore, Norway, Australia, and South Korea.</title><p>The dots show data of individual MENA countries, the grey region encompasses the range of data for MENA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0164500.g002"/></fig><p>In digging deeper into the growth trajectories, individual MENA countries show year-to-year fluctuating patterns of stagnation, decline, and growth (Figures B-E in Section C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). Several countries have repeatedly undergone a decrease in annual output (a contraction in annual number of publications from one year to the next) leading to an erosion of any earlier gains. This partly explains the widened productivity gap. With the exception of Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Oman, all other MENA countries show multiple instances of negative growth (less than -0.2%) or stagnation (growth rate between -0.2% to 0.2% with the results generally robust for other thresholds such as 0.1% or 0.5%) during 1991&#x02013;2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0164500.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0164500.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Average rates of change in annual publications show repeated instances of decline and stagnation (shown in red and black) in publications from MENA countries in contrast to countries in the comparison group (below the gray line).</title><p>The average-three year publications growth rate was computed and classified as unchanged if it was between -0.2% to 0.2%, increasing if greater than 0.2% and decreasing if less than&#x02014;0.2%.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0164500.g003"/></fig><p>In Tunisia, productivity increased from 4.4 in 1981 to 248.2 (papers per million) in 2013. However, due to socio-political unrest since 2011, the growth rate has stalled in the country (Figures B-E in Section C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). Similar impacts of turmoil and military conflicts are visibly perceptible in the data for others including Iraq (1991&#x02013;1993 and 2003&#x02013;2004), Kuwait (1991&#x02013;1993), and Syria (2012&#x02013;2013).</p><p>The rapidly rising trajectories of Singapore and South Korea (as evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g002">Fig 2</xref>) show the impact of sustained policy focus on national technological development (in the backdrop of a more peaceful internal social environment unmarked by military conflict). The rate of growth accelerated in some countries (Qatar, Morocco, Egypt) in MENA in the last seven years (Figures B-E in Section C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>).

In the case of Qatar, however, foreign collaborations have been extensively pursued (Section B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). Senior research administrators in the region pointed out in our interviews that the international collaborations are being pursued for acquiring new knowledge and technical capabilities, and for bringing nascent local programs of teaching and research at par with global practices. In some cases, local researchers seek foreign collaborations due to insufficient local critical mass and lack of local collaborators in their specific fields. The combined effect of these efforts at the macro-level in the country is an indigeneity level that is among the lowest in MENA states.</p><p>In the comparison group, China, Turkey, and South Korea have maintained a relatively high degree of indigeneity (from 85&#x02013;89% in 2000 to 84&#x02013;90% in 2013), whereas in Australia, Norway and Singapore the indigeneity measure has changed from ~73&#x02013;79% in 2000 to 62&#x02013;65% in 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The US fares in the middle going from 82% to 73% in this period.</p><p>These results show a noticeable shift in rate of change around the middle of the last decade for many countries (Figure B in Section D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). In investigating further, we find that the median annual indigeneity change for MENA increases from -0.03% in 2000&#x02013;2005 period to -2.7% during 2006&#x02013;2013. On the other hand, the median annual change for comparison countries is -0.7% and -0.8% respectively during these periods (Figures C-D in Section D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>). The indigeneity in MENA has thus decreased at more than three folds the rate (-2.7% versus -0.8%) as compared to the other group of countries during 2006&#x02013;2013.</p><p>These decreasing levels can be explained in part with the role of modern information technologies (IT) in reducing transaction costs and increasing international collaborations. Researchers, however, have documented the limits to benefits that can be gained from collaboration showing that remote collaborations can be prone to problems of coordination [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and that benefits may accrue only to an extent after which reverse trends may take hold wherein more collaboration impedes productivity [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Recent research also shows that while geographically dispersed teams have access to diverse information that can potentially increase novelty, the dispersion can make it difficult to integrate and effectively utilize the information for developing new knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Scientific research and innovation have long been an international enterprise. However, with increased global interactions in this century, scholars in development and innovation theory seek to explicitly investigate the emerging Global Innovation Networks [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and advance the framework of National Systems of Innovation (NSI) that has received significant interest since the 1990s [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Researchers note that as countries seek to catch up, the maturity and nature of their NSIs will impact their role, hierarchy, and influence within the global networks. Thus, even though the global scientific enterprise becomes more connected, the level and quality of domestic human capital and scientific expertise remains vital for linking local research to global research efforts and for utilizing global research for local applications and needs.</p><p>As the question of international collaborations (that are partially captured with the indigeneity metric) is of increasing salience for countries aiming to build local capacity, we analyzed how productivity and indigeneity are related. We found that the correlation between these two metrics was negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g005">Fig 5</xref>), except for a few cases (Figures E-G in Section D in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>), showing that the productivity gains in these countries have occurred in step with declining indegeniety. This indicates that international collaborations have contributed to the rise in productivity. The impact of international collaborations on scientific contributions by countries has been noted in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0164500.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and this result confirms those findings. However, it also provides a further nuance by indicating whether the drivers of the collaborations are domestic or foreign (with country of corresponding author serving as a proxy indicator) and flags implications for countries seeking to develop local capacity.</p><fig id="pone.0164500.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0164500.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Productivity versus indigeneity shows a negative correlation.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0164500.g005"/></fig><p>The overall comparative results show that the locus of scientific work has shifted out of national borders in MENA countries, and raises important questions for domestic scientific research capacity. While other countries (such as Singapore and Norway) also show decreasing trends for indigeneity, the impact of this trend for MENA can be consequential, given the region&#x02019;s low level of productivity and lack of local research base. The actual (as opposed to expected) impacts of extensive international collaborations needs further understanding as countries in the region attempt to quickly catch up and gain a larger presence in the global research arena.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Specialty</title><p>Our analysis of scientific specialty shows that the focus has shifted from some disciplines such as geological sciences/petroleum engineering to other areas.

Singapore and South Korea (with electronics and semi-conductor industry) have strong focus in materials science (Figures B-C in Section E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>This detailed regional and country level characterization of patterns of specialization and research emphasis can serve as an important tool for informing policy and for assessing how research activities may or may not be along trajectories that support broader national development goals and needs.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Current challenges</title><p>In our semi-structured interviews and discussions, which included a wide range of stakeholders ranging from university presidents to faculty and students, a few common issues were raised consistently across all countries we visited: (1) need for &#x0201c;continuity of forward-looking policies&#x0201d; with continued financial support for science and technology over the next couple of decades; (2) &#x0201c;chronic shortage of human capital&#x0201d; and difficulty of attracting good quality faculty in sufficient numbers; (3) insufficient career incentives that have stymied local interest in pursuing long-term research and technical work in science and innovation; and (4) poor quality of school-level education in science and mathematics that leaves students inadequately prepared for university education.</p><p>These findings provide explanations for some of the trends and features that emerge from our quantitative bibliometrics analysis. The multiple periods of contraction in scientific output in most MENA countries have left deep uncertainties in academic and research communities. Thus, while they appreciate recent investments, there is persistent concern for long-term sustained support.</p><p>In the interviews, several professors pointed to not having a critical mass of other colleagues with whom they have shared interests and complementary areas of expertise in their institution, as well as incentives for faculty that encourage increasing number of publications. The combination of lack of local human capacity and specific measures implemented to boost output may partly explain the rapidly decreasing indigeneity levels that we find in our analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this paper we use a combination of classical and new metrics to provide insights into key features of research in countries with relatively poor statistics. We focused on MENA countries for our analysis. It is a region where science once flourished in the early centuries of the last millennium, but a long and persistent drought in scientific inquiry has since prevailed. There are now some signs of change. We find that the share of global publications in science and engineering from MENA has tripled from 0.6% in 1981 to 1.8% in 2013, with the most rapid rise in the last decade (from 2006 onwards) with almost a 1% gain in global share during that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g001">Fig 1</xref>). There is, however, significant variation in progress at country level in the region&#x02013;and the overall improvements in global share are due to gains in only a few countries.</p><p>Furthermore, while increasing output is important, the issue of quality is salient and will ultimately shape the nature of progress in research capabilities and national development. A key limitation of this analysis is that we have not included the usual metrics of publications quality (such as citation counts or impact factors of journals in which papers are published). Some previous studies have assessed the quality of MENA publications on a limited basis [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this work, we sought to quantify the <italic>extent</italic> of activities using a lower bound (total annual publications, regardless of citation counts) for comparison of countries that are in relatively early stages of developing modern research systems.</p><p>Our results show that a significant part of the progress in MENA has come about through international collaborations, consistent with (but going beyond) global trends, and that MENA countries are diversifying away from a few areas of scientific focus. This shifting geography of research may be a precursor for catch-up in scientific capabilities in the future, and may prove to be a new model wherein developing countries extensively partner with other nations, in the longer term, to come at par on the international science arena. On the other hand, however, the trends of increasing productivity gap and decreasing indigeneity as compared to other countries (with more established science base) may be symptoms of fragility in the domestic research eco-system in MENA. Recent political unrest and lack of opportunities have accelerated migration in many MENA countries, so the trends may represent a phenomenon that is out of the control of national research organizations. An assessment of the productivity of the diaspora could provide important strategic insights for channels of collaboration and future domestic capacity building.</p><p>The measured change from specialty in a few key areas to a more even emphasis across different scientific areas in many MENA countries (Figures D-I in Section E in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>) also provides important indication of an evolving system&#x02013;the direction of which may or may not be aligned with long-term national development goals. The results of our study&#x02013;and more importantly the approach we have presented- can be used to benchmark and inform strategic decision-making. Here, we have focused on quantitative metrics and trends, however, we explore broader societal, institutional, and policy challenges in [<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0164500.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the trends of increased research output are a positive sign. However, other countries are moving faster. Growth in MENA will need to be maintained and further accelerated, as the pressures for expanding economic opportunities for an increasingly young population continue to build where the average annual population growth rate of 3.35% is among the highest in the world (Table B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0164500.s001">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>Regional conflicts, socio-political instability, and lack of sustained support in the past decades for higher education and research have contributed to a widening rather than a narrowing gap in productivity with other countries (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164500.g003">3</xref>). The checkered history of two steps forward and one step back needs to be supplanted with consistent performance&#x02013;and that can only come about with state-level support in concert with public engagement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0164500.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>Section A in this file provides further details of the data and methods used in computing metrics using Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0164500.e001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0164500.e005">5</xref>.
