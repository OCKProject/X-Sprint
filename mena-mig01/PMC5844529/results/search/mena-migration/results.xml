 <result pre="Discussion This meta-analysis is the first genetic anthropology study in" exact="MENA" post="region, and included 100 populations from 36 Arab and"/>
 <result pre="loci. The identification of shared haplotypes between Arabs and other" exact="Mediterranean" post="and Asian populations is attributed to the higher admixture"/>
