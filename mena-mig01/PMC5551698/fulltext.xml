Even stationary cells such as those within interconnected sheets of epithelial cells require continuous actin polymerization, not only for membrane dynamics such as endocytosis, but also to maintain actin-dependent adhesive junctions and repair breaches in the epithelial barrier that are likely to occur from normal wear and tear (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Marchiando et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Brieher, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Enyedi and Niethammer, 2015</xref>). Hence, the physiological function of both highly motile and relatively sessile cells requires continuous actin polymerization.</p><p>Cells generate actin polymer either by nucleating new filaments de novo from G-actin subunits or by elongating existing filaments. Both nucleation and elongation are highly regulated and are under the control of different factors. The Arp2/3 complex, for example, is an important actin nucleation factor whose activity is controlled by a long list of nucleation-promoting factors such as N-WASP, Scar/WAVE, and others that activate Arp2/3 at specific cellular locations at specified times (<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Welch and Mitchison, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Machesky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>). Arp2/3-dependent nucleation reactions are most frequently associated with motility. Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation reactions are important for intracellular motility of pathogens including the propulsion of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, <italic>Rickettsia</italic>, and <italic>Vaccinia</italic> (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Welch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Egile et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Frischknecht et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Loisel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Yarar et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Jeng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Weisswange et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Welch and Way, 2013</xref>), as well as the actin-dependent propulsion of endosomes and internalization of phagosomes (<xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Moreau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">May et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Duncan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Derivery et al., 2009</xref>). Arp2/3 is also crucial for the formation of lamellipodia that push the leading edge of migrating cells forward (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Welch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Suraneni et al., 2012</xref>). Beyond these well-established roles for Arp2/3 in motility, the complex also contributes to the assembly of actin networks in nonmotile cells, where it is important for the assembly of actin at cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell junctions (<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Verma et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Abu Taha et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Ena/VASP family proteins Ena, VASP, and Ena/VASP-like protein (EVL), on the other hand, are a family of actin-elongation factors that promote the growth of the barbed ends of existing actin filaments (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bear and Gertler, 2009</xref>). These factors can increase the rate at which filament barbed ends elongate (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Winkelman et al., 2014</xref>), and they help shield the growing barbed end from termination by capping protein (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bear et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barzik et al., 2005</xref>). Inside the cell, VASP family proteins often localize to Arp2/3-dependent structures, including lamellipodia (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Rottner et al., 1999</xref>), and at cell&#x02013;cell contacts (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Scott et al., 2006</xref>). Ena/VASP proteins can even promote Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly by binding to WAVE (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Havrylenko et al., 2015</xref>). Cells contain several Ena/VASP binding partners that presumably help localize these elongation factors to specific sites in cells (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bear and Gertler, 2009</xref>). Lamellipodin, for example, is important for localizing VASP to the leading edge of lamellipodia, where VASP helps polymerize actin to push the leading edge forward (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Mullins, 2015</xref>). Thus far, however, lamellipodin and profilin are the only proteins known to stimulate the elongation activity of Ena/VASP proteins (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>). Because actin assembly is so heavily regulated, it is likely that additional factors and mechanisms controlling actin polymerization remain to be identified.</p><p>We recently identified CRMP-1 as a novel factor that promotes Arp2/3-dependent assembly of <italic>Listeria</italic> actin comet tails (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Yu-Kemp and Brieher, 2016</xref>). <italic>Listeria</italic> is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that recruits proteins from the eukaryotic host to build the actin comet tail that propels the pathogen through the host&#x02019;s cytoplasm and to adjacent cells to spread the infection (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Welch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Loisel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Brieher et al., 2004</xref>). CRMP-1 is one member of a family of five related proteins implicated in a variety of cytoskeleton-dependent processes such as neuronal growth cone motility and collapse, neuronal polarity, endocytosis, and the anchoring of ion channels in the plane of the membrane. (<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Goshima et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Arimura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Inagaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Brittain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Maniar et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular mechanisms through which CRMP proteins mediate these processes are still mysterious. One popular model is that CRMP binds to tubulin to promote microtubule assembly (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fukata et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Khazaei et al., 2014</xref>). Other studies suggest that CRMPs might promote or inhibit actin filament bundling (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Rosslenbroich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>).

To do so, we first performed immunostaining with a CRMP-1 antibody and phalloidin to visualize the relative cellular locations of CRMP-1 and actin. MDCK is an epithelial cell line that forms cadherin-dependent cell&#x02013;cell adhesions once the cells contact each other. Therefore, we also stained for E-cadherin to mark the cell border. In a young MDCK monolayer that had been at confluence for 1 d, we detected CRMP-1 colocalizing with actin and E-cadherin at cell borders at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, top</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><?Figure Med?><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>CRMP-1 is expressed in MDCK cells and localizes to junctional and cortical actin.</bold> Immunostaining of confluent monolayers of MDCK cells showing that CRMP-1 (green) localizes with actin (purple) at cell&#x02013;cell contacts, which are marked with E-cadherin (red).

To determine whether CRMP-1 also localized to the same cellular localizations after the cells polarized, we performed the same staining on a mature monolayer that had been at confluence for 6 d. Unlike the young monolayer, which is thin enough that most of the actin could be imaged in a single optical plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, top</xref>), the mature monolayer has a height of &#x0223c;2.5 &#x000b5;m. At the apical surface, actin filaments concentrated at cell borders. At the basal surface, actin filaments were in stress fibers. Under this condition, CRMP-1 localized with actin at cell borders, where it still concentrated with E-cadherin and actin near apical cell&#x02013;cell junctions, but not at the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, middle, apical view). In contrast, CRMP-1 did not concentrate at cell borders near the basal surface of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, bottom, basal view). In addition, a strong CRMP-1 signal was present inside the cell in these aged monolayers, which corresponded to the cortical actin network beneath the apical and basal surfaces of the cell. Note that the intense nucleolar staining is not specific, because we still see it in the cells depleted of CRMP-1 (Fig. S1). CRMP-1 periodically showed some localization to basal stress fibers in mature monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, bottom, basal view), even though the localization was not seen in a young monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, top</xref>). Together, these staining results indicate that CRMP-1 is expressed and localizes to actin structures in MDCK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>CRMP-1 and Arp2/3 assemble the same actin networks</title><p>To test whether CRMP-1 contributes to actin assembly and organization, we depleted it from MDCK cells using shRNAs.

To better assess whether these actin networks were in fact Arp2/3 dependent, we depleted either Arp3 or the p34 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex using shRNA (Fig. S2, B and C). In both cases, actin accumulation in the cortex was diminished relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Quantification of the results showed that a reduction in Arp3 or p34 led to a 50% or 50&#x02013;80% reduction in cortical actin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The actin signal was also reduced at cell&#x02013;cell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>), which is consistent with a loss in cortical actin in general, but the decrease in actin intensity at cell boundaries in the knockdowns might be the result of a change in cell height.</p><p>In addition to the loss of actin, we noticed a significant increase in cell spreading in the plane of the substrate in cells depleted of CRMP-1, p34, or Arp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). In each case, the areas of depleted cells were five to eight times larger than the areas of control cells. The increase in cell area suggested that the knockdowns might have affected cell volume. We estimated cell volume in rounded cells than had been detached from the substrate by incubation in calcium- and magnesium-free medium. These estimates suggest that knockdown cells are of approximately twice the volume of control cells. The increase in cell volume might be accompanied by an increase in nuclear size. Certainly, the area of the nucleus in these flat cells was twofold higher than that in control cells (Fig. S3). A more detailed analysis will have to be performed to understand the possible changes in cell and nuclear size. Nevertheless, the phenotypes show that CRMP-1, p34, and Arp3 contribute to the formation of the same actin networks and produce the same cell phenotype of increased cell spreading.</p></sec><sec id="s05"><title>CRMP-1 does not promote WAVE-mediated activation of Arp2/3</title><p>Because CRMP-1 promotes Arp2/3-dependent <italic>Listeria</italic> actin comet tail formation, our first hypothesis was that CRMP-1 would also enhance Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly in cells.

Eukaryotic cells do not have an obvious ActA homolog, but CRMP-1 might work with the known eukaryotic activators of Arp2/3.

Because ActA is constitutively active, we hypothesized that CRMP-1 would also promote the ability of constitutively active fragments of WAVE to activate Arp2/3. To test for CRMP-1 stimulation of Arp2/3 activation, we used pyrene actin to track actin polymerization with two different constitutively active WAVE constructs (<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Suetsugu et al., 2001</xref>) containing the VCA domain &#x000b1; the proline-rich domain, as well as the constitutively active VVCA domain of N-WASP. To our surprise, CRMP-1 did not stimulate the ability of any of these nucleation-promoting factors to activate Arp2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, C and D</xref>). Therefore, although CRMP-1 can stimulate the ability of ActA, which is a constitutively active nucleation-promoting factor for Arp2/3, it cannot stimulate the ability of constitutively active forms of WAVE or N-WASP to activate Arp2/3.</p></sec><sec id="s06"><title>CRMP-1 works with VASP family proteins to promote actin assembly</title><p>We sought another explanation for the severe loss of actin that occurs when CRMP-1 is depleted from cells. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that EVL is necessary for actin assembly off cadherin-enriched junctional membranes (<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Brieher, 2013</xref>). CRMP-1 is also present on these membranes (Fig. S4). Ena/VASP family proteins including EVL promote actin assembly from actin filament barbed ends (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Pasic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib89" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Svitkina, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Winkelman et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore tested whether CRMP-1 could enhance actin assembly in the presence of EVL. 1.5-&#x000b5;M solutions of pyrene actin containing 0 or 40 nM EVL were induced to polymerize. After 30 min, either 100 nM CRMP-1 or a compensatory amount of buffer was added to the reactions.

CRMP-1 might also contribute to the actin assembly at cell&#x02013;cell adhesive contacts, which would help explain why perturbing CRMP-1 leads to a decrease in cell&#x02013;cell adhesion. CRMP-1 is also important for the assembly of <italic>Listeria</italic> actin comet tails (<xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Yu-Kemp and Brieher, 2016</xref>). CRMP-1 binds directly to EVL and stimulates EVL&#x02019;s intrinsic actin filament elongation activity. We therefore propose that a major function of CRMP-1 is to facilitate the assembly of actin networks by accelerating actin filament elongation rates. Defects in actin polymerization could easily account for the various phenotypes that result from perturbing CRMP function in other cell types. Physiological regulation of CRMP-dependent actin polymerization could also explain how CRMPs control neuronal growth advance in response to guidance cues such as Semaphorin 3A.</p><p>We found that CRMP-1 binds to EVL and promotes its ability to elongate actin filaments. EVL is related to VASP and Ena, and all three proteins are weakly processive actin filament elongation factors (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">K&#x000fc;hnel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barzik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Applewhite et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Pasic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Winkelman et al., 2014</xref>). All three family members contain an EVH1 domain that is separated from an EVH2 domain by a proline-rich segment. The EVH1 domain targets the protein to different locations within the cell (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Bear and Gertler, 2009</xref>). The EVH2 domain binds to F-actin and G-actin and is responsible for accelerating barbed-end growth (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bachmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2007</xref>). Current models of elongation propose that actin monomers are transferred from Ena/VASP to the growing barbed end to which Ena/VASP is attached. CRMP-1 binds to the EVH2 domain of EVL, and CRMP-1 also binds to F-actin. Therefore, CRMP-1 could promote EVL-dependent actin elongation by increasing either the rate at which actin monomers are transferred from the EVH2 G-actin binding site to the barbed end or the affinity of EVH2 for F-actin. Our results favor the former mechanism, because we did not detect a change in the concentration of EVL required to reach the half-maximal rate in elongation with or without CRMP. Although Ena/VASP/EVL interact with many different proteins, profilin and lamellipodin are the only other binding partners known to modulate elongation activity (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Profilin binds to the proline-rich domain (<xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Reinhard et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2007</xref>), lamellipodin binds to EVH1, and CRMP-1 binds to EVH2 (<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Mullins, 2015</xref>). EVH2 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A and protein kinase G. These phosphorylations are known to alter VASP binding to F-actin (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Benz et al., 2009</xref>). Phosphorylation of EVH2 might also control its ability to bind CRMP-1, to provide cells with an additional control point to modulate actin polymerization.</p><p>CRMP-1 and EVL proved to be just as important as Arp2/3 and WAVE2 for assembly of the actin cortex, actin at adherens junctions, and lamellipodia in MDCK cells. This could mean that actin filament elongation reactions are especially important in MDCK cells. Such a situation could arise if the cells contained very high concentrations of capping protein, which binds to barbed ends and terminates further growth (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). Ena/VASP/EVL can antagonize capping protein, but the effect is weak (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bear et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barzik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Pasic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</xref>). Not only might CRMP-1 accelerate actin filament elongation rates, it might also help EVL shield barbed ends from capping protein. Alternatively, CRMP-1 and EVL might contribute to the assembly of Arp2/3-WAVE&#x02013;dependent actin assembly in other ways. For example, VASP binds to WAVE (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Havrylenko et al., 2015</xref>) and CRMP-1 binds to the WAVE-associated protein Sra1 (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Kawano et al., 2005</xref>), which is important for WAVE- and Arp2/3-dependent lamellipodia formation (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Kunda et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, in addition to elongating filaments, CRMP and EVL might also contribute to Arp2/3 activation in lamellipodia.</p><p>Ena, VASP, and EVL are homologous, with shared biochemical activities. Deleting all three genes in mice produces a more severe phenotype than deleting any individual gene or pair of genes, underscoring their functional redundancy (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Kwiatkowski et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, VASP was unable to substitute for EVL in MDCK cells. Although EVL produced the exact same actin networks as CRMP-1, WAVE2, and Arp2/3, VASP assembled more actin stress fibers on the basal surface of the cell, which has been seen before. Our data also revealed that EVL is important for lamellipodia formation in MDCK cells; yet VASP is not. An earlier study in fibroblasts showed that perturbing Ena/VASP did not affect the formation of lamellipodia yet altered the persistency of the protrusion (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Bear et al., 2002</xref>). Although Ena, VASP, and EVL have similar biochemical properties in vitro, they might contribute to the assembly of different actin networks in different types of cells. Other compensatory mechanisms might be masking interesting differences between the family members in the whole organism (<xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Withee et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Cells depleted of CRMP-1, EVL, WAVE2, or components of the Arp2/3 complex spread extensively, producing an enormous apical membrane (at the expense of lateral membrane), resulting in very thin cells. The phenotype eventually corrects itself, at least to some extent, as the cells pack more as the monolayer ages. This phenotype has been seen before. Inhibition of the pointed actin capping protein tropomodulin, ankyrin, or p120 catenin produces thin cells with increased apical surface per cell and reduced lateral membrane (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Kizhatil and Bennett, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Kizhatil et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Bulgakova and Brown, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, ankyrin-, actin-, and cadherin-mediated cell&#x02013;cell adhesions all determine whether cells preferentially spread on the extracellular matrix or on each other to expand the lateral membrane. The increase in cell spreading in the plane of the substrate also correlated with a possible doubling in cell volume and nuclear size.</p><p>Epithelial cells form extensive cell&#x02013;cell adhesive junctions that are essential for epithelial tissue to create a barrier separating two distinct environments. E-cadherin is the major cell&#x02013;cell adhesion molecule expressed in epithelial cells, and its activity is actin dependent. We have shown that CRMP-1, EVL, WAVE2, and Arp2/3 are all critical for the formation of the apical actin cortex and assembly of the actin cytoskeleton at cell&#x02013;cell contacts. As a consequence, perturbing any of these proteins compromises cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, resulting in holes in the epithelial sheet, which is catastrophic for epithelial function. Research on cadherin&#x02013;actin interactions has thus far focused on how &#x003b1;-catenin links cadherins to actin filaments that are under myosin II&#x02013;dependent tension (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">le Duc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Yonemura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Buckley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Nelson and Weis, 2016</xref>). Our results here show that actin polymerization is at least as important for cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and the structural integrity of epithelial sheets as mechanically stable linkages that connect cadherins to contractile actin networks. When Arp2/3-, EVL-, or CRMP-1&#x02013;mediated actin filament dynamics fail, the monolayer becomes perforated with holes that will have a harder time healing, because these same factors are critical for lamellipodia formation that could quickly seal the wound.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s13"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s14"><title>Plasmids and protein purification</title><p>For recombinant protein expression, human CRMP-1 or human EVL (full length, EVH1 domain, and EVH2 domain) was cloned into pET30a.
