We have previously shown that cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, in particular tyrosine 421, promotes actin polymerization at newly-forming invadopodia, promoting their maturation to matrix-degrading structures. However, the mechanism by which cells regulate the cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle at invadopodia is unknown. Mena, an actin barbed-end capping protein antagonist, is expressed as various splice-isoforms. The Mena<sup>INV</sup> isoform is upregulated in migratory and invasive sub-populations of breast carcinoma cells, and is involved in tumor cell intravasation. Here we show that forced Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression increases invadopodium maturation to a far greater extent than equivalent expression of other Mena isoforms. Mena<sup>INV</sup> is recruited to invadopodium precursors just after their initial assembly at the plasma membrane, and promotes the phosphorylation of cortactin tyrosine 421 at invadopodia. In addition, we show that cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421 is suppressed by the phosphatase PTP1B, and that PTP1B localization to the invadopodium is reduced by Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression. We conclude that Mena<sup>INV</sup> promotes invadopodium maturation by inhibiting normal dephosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosine 421 by the phosphatase PTP1B.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>It is estimated that 90% of deaths from solid tumors are not caused by the primary tumor, but the further dissemination and growth of secondary and tertiary tumors at distal sites, known as metastases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.

Using time-lapse imaging of live MLTn3 cells expressing TagRFP-cortactin and eGFP-Mena, eGFP-Mena11a or eGFP-Mena<sup>INV</sup>, we found that Mena and Mena<sup>INV</sup> co-localized with cortactin at newly-forming invadopodium precursors an average of 21 and 18 seconds after cortactin arrival, respectively, while Mena11a arrived slightly later, approximately 32&#x02009;seconds after cortactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>). This arrival delay relative to cortactin indicates that Mena<sup>INV</sup> is recruited to the invadopodium precursor at the same time as Tks5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. Thus, Mena<sup>INV</sup> arrives at the invadopodium precursor during a period prior to invadopodium maturation that is associated with Tks5-dependent stabilization of the precursor at the plasma membrane<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The arrival of Mena<sup>INV</sup> during this period of invadopodium stabilization and actin polymerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> supports its role in directly promoting invadopodium maturation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression increases cortactin phosphorylation at invadopodia</title><p>Having established both the presence of Mena<sup>INV</sup> at invadopodium precursors, and an increase in invadopodium maturation in cells expressing Mena<sup>INV</sup>, we began to investigate how Mena<sup>INV</sup> specifically affects invadopodium maturation. The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Arg kinase in response to EGFR and &#x003b2;1-integrin activation have been shown to be key signaling steps in the transition of the invadopodium from the late precursor stage to a mature structure capable of degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>.

Interestingly, we found that in MDA-MB-231 cells that were serum-starved Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression produced a significant increase in cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421 within invadopodia relative to the eGFP control. Mena11a expression, which did not promote invadopodium maturation, produced no significant effect on cortactin phosphorylation, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Expression of Mena without either the INV or 11a exons also produced an increase in cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421 within invadopodia, but this increase was significantly less than that produced by Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus expression of Mena<sup>INV</sup> and, to a lesser extent, Mena, but not Mena11a increases cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421 independently of exogenous soluble growth factors, such as EGF or HGF. Given the known regulation of invadopodium maturation by cortactin phosphorylation, the ability of Mena<sup>INV</sup> to increase cortactin phosphorylation at invadopodia may, at least in part, underlie Mena<sup>INV</sup>-driven increases in invadopodium maturation and matrix degradation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>.</p><p>To determine if the increase in mature invadopodia produced by Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression is dependent on the increase in cortactin tyrosine 421 phosphorylation, we used a non-phosphorylatable Y&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;F mutant of cortactin. If the increase in invadopodium maturation caused by Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression is dependent on cortactin phosphorylation, then cells expressing the phosphorylation-deficient mutant of cortactin should not produce additional mature invadopodia when Mena<sup>INV</sup> is overexpressed. MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing wild-type murine cortactin (cortactin-WT) or a cortactin mutant incapable of being phosphorylated at tyrosine 421 (cortactin-Y421F), were each depleted of endogenous human cortactin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>) and transfected with eGFP or eGFP-Mena<sup>INV</sup>. Quantification of the number of mature invadopodia that formed after plating the cells on a thin fluorescent ECM indicated that Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression increased the number of mature invadopodia in cells expressing cortactin-WT by 3&#x02013;4-fold, but produced no change in the number of mature invadopodia in cells expressing cortactin-Y421F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>).

Thus, PTP1B regulates cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421 in invadopodium precursors of both rat and human breast carcinoma, limiting invadopodium maturation.

It should be noted that previously it was reported that exogenous Mena expression increases the level of ECM degradation in MTLn3 cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, while here we have found that exogenous Mena alone does not produce a significant increase in the number of mature invadopodia per cell. Since degradation area is not directly related to the number of mature invadopodia in a cell but rather is a measurement also related to the extent of cell motility over the ECM degradation target, we used in our study direct measures of mature invadopodium number to avoid misinterpretation of the effects of Mena isoform expression on invadopodium maturation.

We provide evidence that PTP1B regulates cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421 in invadopodia.

Our finding that Mena<sup>INV</sup> is able to increase tyrosine 421 cortactin phosphorylation at invadopodia in the absence of exogenously-added soluble growth factors, such as EGF, raises the possibility that other cues, such as contact with the ECM can trigger this effect in invadopodia. &#x003b2;1 integrin binds to and activates Arg at invadopodia, leading to enhanced cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421, and &#x003b2;1 integrin activity is necessary for invadopodium maturation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>.

Here we have found that eGFP-tagged Mena, Mena<sup>INV</sup>, Mena11a, and endogenous Mena isoforms, localize to a similar proportion of invadopodium precursors. Exogenous Mena, Mena<sup>INV</sup> and Mena11a arrive at invadopodium precursors within seconds of each other, but Mena<sup>INV</sup> was able to increase invadopodium maturation to a much greater extent than either of the other isoforms. Though Mena11a arrives at invadopodium precursors an average of ~14s later than Mena<sup>INV</sup>, all three isoforms arrived well before the minimum two-minute lag-time between precursor formation and matrix degradation. Furthermore, the slightly later arrival of Mena11a at invadopodium precursors does not explain its inability to promote cortactin phosphorylation at invadopodia in steady-state conditions, unlike Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). These results suggest that the INV exon does not significantly alter Mena localization to invadopodia, but rather affects Mena function at invadopodia. PTP1B also contains a domain (LEPPPEHIPPPP) resembling the consensus EVH1 binding motif, and has been shown to bind to Mena containing an intact EVH1 domain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression has been shown to prevent PTP1B association with the EGFR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>, and here we show that Mena<sup>INV</sup> decreases association of PTP1B with invadopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Fig. 8</xref>). Hence, our data are consistent with the speculation that the INV exon enables Mena to disrupt the association of PTP1B with its substrates and this has the consequence of increasing invadopodium maturation by interfering with the proximity of PTP1B to cortactin at the invadopodium, thereby suppressing cortactin tyrosine dephosphorylation at that site.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that eGFP-Mena expression also increases invadopodium maturation in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A,B</xref>), which endogenously express detectible Mena<sup>INV</sup>

Since co-expressed Mena isoforms can associate in heterotetramers a given Mena isoform may thereby influence the localization and stability of other Mena isoforms that are co-expressed. Such heterotetramers may therefore allow exogenous Mena to recruit and/or stabilize endogenous Mena<sup>INV</sup> at invadopodia in MDA-MB-231 cells. Thus, Mena expression may promote invadopodium maturation through its association with Mena<sup>INV</sup> in tetramers, yet this would not be expected to occur in cell lines that do not express Mena<sup>INV</sup> endogenously.</p><p>Another possible reason why Mena overexpression can promote invadopodium maturation is through its effects on actin polymerization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. It seems plausible that Mena<sup>INV</sup> has a specific role in displacing PTP1B while increased levels of Mena (and/or Mena<sup>INV</sup>) would enhance actin polymerization. However, this seems less likely since the switch to invadopodium maturation precedes cofilin-dependent actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9">Fig. 9</xref>) suggesting that the effect provided by endogenous Mena<sup>INV</sup> on cortactin phosphorylation is the dominant factor in invadopodium maturation.

Mena<sup>INV</sup> then displaces PTP1B from the invadopodium precursor (red line), preventing PTP1B from dephosphorylating cortactin at tyrosine 421 (dotted arrow). Y421-cortactin (red) phosphorylation leads to cofilin release and actin severing to produce a greater concentration of barbed ends. Cortactin phosphorylation also recruits Nck1 to the invadopodium, which acts through N-WASP to produce greater levels of Arp2/3-mediated actin branching from newly elongating barbed ends produced by cofilin severing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Mena promotes actin polymerization by displacing Capping Protein (CP) from the barbed end, and Mena<sup>INV</sup> promotes additional actin polymerization at invadopodia through enhanced cortactin phosphorylation at tyrosine 421, as described above, which leads to invadopodium elongation and maturation.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="srep36142-f9"/></fig></floats-group></article>
