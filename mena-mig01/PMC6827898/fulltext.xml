ZEB1/2 are EMT transcription factors that are positively correlated with EMT phenotypes and breast cancer aggressiveness. ZEB1/2 regulate the alternative splicing and hence isoform switching of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) by repressing the epithelial splicing regulatory proteins, ESRP1 and ESRP2. Here, we show that the mesenchymal-like phenotypes of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells are dependent on autocrine FGF&#x02013;FGFR signaling. Mesenchymal-like OSCC cells express low levels of ESRP1/2 and high levels of ZEB1/2, resulting in constitutive expression of the IIIc-isoform of FGFR, FGFR(IIIc). By contrast, epithelial-like OSCC cells showed opposite expression profiles for these proteins and constitutive expression of the IIIb-isoform of FGFR2, FGFR2(IIIb). Importantly, ERK1/2 was constitutively phosphorylated through FGFR1(IIIc), which was activated by factors secreted autonomously by mesenchymal-like OSCC cells and involved in sustained high-level expression of ZEB1. Antagonizing FGFR1 with either inhibitors or siRNAs considerably repressed ZEB1 expression and restored epithelial-like traits. Therefore, autocrine FGF&#x02013;FGFR(IIIc) signaling appears to be responsible for sustaining ZEB1/2 at high levels and the EMT phenotype in OSCC cells.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></funding-source><award-id>15H05018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0793-1679</contrib-id><name><surname>Saitoh</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>JSPS KAKENHI</institution></funding-source><award-id>18H02969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0793-1679</contrib-id><name><surname>Saitoh</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004398</institution-id><institution>Mitsubishi Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0793-1679</contrib-id><name><surname>Saitoh</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Mitsubishi Foundation, JSPS KAKENHI grant number 18H02969, and JSPS KAKENHI grant number 15H05018.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common malignancies in head and neck cancers[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most patients on their first visit to hospitals are diagnosed with locoregional initial symptoms of the disease. After various treatments, including surgical operation, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or combination, the five-year survival rate remains less than 50% due to its aggressive invasiveness and resistance to treatments[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategy would be of significant benefit to the development of successful therapies.</p><p>The process of cancer cell invasion involves the loss of cell&#x02013;cell interactions along with the acquisition of motility, and is partly associated with the epithelial&#x02013;mesenchymal transition (EMT)[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EMT involves dramatic cellular changes in which epithelial cells loosen their attachments to neighboring cells, lose their apico-basal polarity, become elongated, and display increased motility. EMT therefore forms the first step of the invasion&#x02013;metastasis cascade. After invading through basement membranes and blood/lymphatic vessel walls, cells undergoing EMT survive in the bloodstream as circulating tumor cells, and, lastly, extravasate into distant organs. Upon arriving at distant metastasized tissues, the cancer cells undergo a reversion process, the mesenchymal&#x02013;epithelial transition (MET)[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The EMT process is regulated by several transcription factors known as EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs), including the &#x003b4;EF1 family of two-handed zinc-finger factors (ZEB1 [Zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1]/&#x003b4;EF1 [&#x003b4;-crystallin/E2-box factor 1] and ZEB2/SIP1 [Smad-interacting protein1]), the Snai1 family (Snail, Slug, and Smuc), and basic helix-loop-helix factors (Twist and E12/E47). Among these, the levels of ZEB1/2 in particular correlate positively with EMT phenotypes and the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217451.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It remains unclear, however, why expression of ZEB1/2 is sustained at high levels in aggressive cancer cells.</p><p>The alternative splicing machinery is also involved in regulating EMT[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epithelial splicing regulatory proteins (ESRPs) 1 and 2, also known as RNA-recognition motif&#x02013;containing proteins Rbm35a and Rbm35b, respectively, induce the switching of alternative splicing of transcripts, such as fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), CD44, Rac1, p120 catenin, and Mena. ZEB1/2 are preferentially recruited to the promoter region of <italic>ESRP1</italic>, and suppress the transcription of <italic>ESRP1</italic> during EMT[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217451.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Despite the similar primary structures of the ESRP1 and ESRP2 proteins, the functions of the two proteins differ slightly in OSCC cells[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>FGFR</italic> genes encode four functional receptors (FGFR1&#x02013;4) with three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, namely, Ig-I, Ig-II, and Ig-III. The Ig-III domain is regulated by alternative splicing, which produces either the IIIb isoforms, FGFR1(IIIb)&#x02013;FGFR3(IIIb), or the IIIc isoforms, FGFR1(IIIc)&#x02013;FGFR3(IIIc), which have distinct FGF binding specificities[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mesenchymal cells expressing the IIIc-isoform respond to FGF2, also known as basic FGF, and FGF4. By contrast, epithelial cells generally expressing the IIIb isoform consequently respond to FGF7, also known as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), and FGF10[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, cancer cells with low expression of ESRP1/2 and high expression of ZEB1/2, are associated with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, and express only the IIIc isoforms. Conversely, cells that express low levels of ZEB1/2 and high levels of ESRP1/2 are associated with favorable prognoses, and exhibit constitutive expression of the IIIb isoforms[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we determined the EMT phenotypes of OSCC cells and found that FGFR2-IIIb was ubiquitously expressed in epithelial-like OSCC cells. Among various OSCC cells, we determined that TSU and HOC313 cells exhibited mesenchymal-like phenotypes with high motility. In addition, we found that TSU and HOC313 cells exhibited high levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and expressed low levels of ESRP1/2 along with high levels of ZEB1/2 levels, resulting in constitutive expression of only FGFR1(IIIc). The FGFR1(IIIc) isoform is apparently activated by soluble factors secreted autonomously by these cells and is needed to sustain high-level expression of ZEB1/2. When we antagonized FGFR1 by either using an inhibitor or specific siRNAs, resulting in the inactivation of ERK1/2 and repression of ZEB1/ZEB2, we observed partial phenotypic changes to epithelial traits. Therefore, sustained high-level expression of ZEB1/2 mediated by the FGFR1c-ERK pathway may maintain the mesenchymal-like phenotypes of OSCC cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human OSCC, TSU, HOC313, OBC-01, OSC-19, OSC-20, and OTC-04 cells were gifts from Dr. E.

When ESRP1 was ectopically overexpressed during TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced EMT, FGFR2(IIIb) changed to FGFR1(IIIb)[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Taken together, conversion of FGFR2(IIIb) to FGFR1(IIIc) during EMT requires transcriptional regulation and alternative splicing machinery dependent on ESRP1/2. These observations prompted us to investigate the potential involvement of TGF-&#x003b2; that is secreted autonomously by OSCC cells. When endogenous TGF-&#x003b2; was inhibited by a TGF-&#x003b2; receptor inhibitor, FGFR isoform switching and the regulation of <italic>FGFR1</italic> and <italic>FGFR2</italic> mRNA were not significantly altered in OSCC cells, in agreement with our previous observation in breast cancer cells[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Conversely, TGF-&#x003b2; treatment also failed to regulate both isoform switching and transcription of FGFR1/2. Therefore, in addition to isoform switching by ESRP1/2-mediated alternative splicing, signaling pathway(s) apart from the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway may be involved in the expression of FGFR1(IIIc) in mesenchymal-like OSCC.</p><p>ZEB1 and ZEB2 are known to be extensively upregulated by TGF-&#x003b2; in both normal epithelial cells and cancer cells[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. ZEB1/2 suppress the expression of ESRP1 by binding to its promoter region, thereby inducing the expression of FGFR(IIIc) isoforms[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] whereas antagonizing FGFR1(IIIc) downregulates ZEB1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217451.g003">Fig 3</xref>). These findings suggest that, during the early stages of cancer, TGF-&#x003b2; accumulates gradually in cancerous tissues[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217451.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] where it subsequently induces EMT by inducing ZEB1/2 expression. Once ZEB1/2 expression has been upregulated, the cells will express FGFR(IIIc) isoforms. Soluble factors, such as FGF2, secreted autonomously by cancer cells undergoing EMT, activate FGFR(IIIc) and ERK pathways to sustain high ZEB1/2 levels. Because FGF2 is itself known to be induced by either TGF-&#x003b2; or FGF2[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0217451.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], a positive feedback loop of autocrine FGF2 signaling can be initiated by TGF-&#x003b2; and sustained by FGF2, thereby maintaining mesenchymal phenotypes. If this positive feedback loop was generated, the cells maintain EMT phenotypes even in the absence of TGF-&#x003b2;. Following that, abundant distribution of FGF2/4 in the cancer microenvironment further stimulates FGFR(IIIc) isoforms in cancer cells undergoing EMT and sustains EMT phenotypes even in the vascular and lymphatic systems. Thus, the addiction of mesenchymal phenotypes of OSCC cells could be switched from the TGF-&#x003b2; axis to the FGF&#x02013;FGFR axis. Finally, ZEB1 and ZEB2 promote the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase to the promoter region by interacting with each other, resulting in epigenetic regulation of EMT marker genes such as E-cadherin[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>FGF2 was previously reported to be produced by the cells of primary prostate carcinomas with metastasis, and that FGF2 causes the switching of FGFR isoforms from IIIb to IIIc[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Similar to these observations based on prostate cancer, mesenchymal-like OSCC cells also produced soluble factors that activate FGFR1(IIIc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217451.g003">Fig 3B and 3C</xref>). However, the pathological significance of isoform switching from FGFR2(IIIb) to FGFR1(IIIc) isoform remains unclear, because both FGFR isoforms have almost the same intracellular structure and tyrosine kinase domains. N-cadherin has been reported to interact selectively with FGFR1(IIIc)[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], suggesting that N-cadherin, expressed in mesenchymal-like OSCC cells, can cooperate to transduce unique signals to sustain high-level expression of ZEB1/2.</p><p>An antibody that preferentially recognizes only FGFR1(IIIc) was recently developed[<xref rid="pone.0217451.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, antibodies that preferentially recognize specific isoforms of other FGFRs have yet to be generated, probably due to the high degree of structural similarity between their extracellular domains. Therefore, diagnosis and therapy, which specifically target the IIIc isoforms, will require the development of methods that can recognize the IIIc isoform proteins specifically, as well as anti-tumor drugs that can target the IIIc isoform proteins specifically.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0217451.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0217451.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0217451.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>mRNA levels of ESRP and EMT-TFs in OSCC cells.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold>
