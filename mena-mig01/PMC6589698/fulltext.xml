Membrane-associated actin regulation factors, such as myosin-1, serve as key molecules to link phosphatidylinositol signals to podosome assembly. Here, we report that long-tailed myosin-1e (Myo1e) is enriched at the ventral layer of the podosome core in a PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent manner. The combination of TH1 and TH2 (TH12) of Myo1e tail domains contains the essential motif for PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent membrane association and ventral localization at the podosome. TH12 KR2A (K772A and R782A) becomes dissociated from the plasma membrane. While F-actin polymerizations are initialized from the ventral layer of the podosome, TH12 precedes the recruitment of N-WASP and Arp2/3 in the initial phase of podosome formation. Overexpression of TH12, not TH12 KR2A, impedes PI(3,4,5)P3 signaling, restrains F-actin polymerization, and inhibits podosome formation. TH12 also suppresses gelatin degradation and migration speed of invadopodia-forming A375 melanoma cells. Thus, TH12 domain of Myo1e serves as a regulatory component to connect phosphatidylinositol signaling to F-actin polymerization at the podosome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cell-matrix adhesion formation involves extracellular ligand binding, as well as intracellular signal transduction (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hynes, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Schiller and Fassler, 2013</xref>).

During the formation of podosomes, there is a distinct F-actin polymerization at the center of each podosome (podosome core) surrounded by adhesion-related proteins (podosome ring; <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">van den Dries <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Labernadie <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). N-WASP and Arp2/3 are the key factors to trigger F-actin polymerization at the podosome core. Various F-actin regulating molecules and motor proteins, such as myosin1e (Myo1e) are also located at the podosome (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ouderkirk and Krendel, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids and its derivatives often serve as important signal messengers in the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007</xref>). Through the activation of PI-specific kinases, the inositol ring in the head group of PI can be phosphorylated at the third, fourth, and fifth hydroxyl groups. In the plasma membrane, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2), and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) often serve as upstream signals to regulate a wide variety of cellular events, such as cell proliferation and cell migration (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Balla, 2013</xref>). Negatively charged PI lipids can locally recruit N-WASP, promote Cdc42-GTP level, and activate Arp2/3-mediated F-actin polymerization (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Insall and Weiner, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Papayannopoulos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). The activation of PI-specific kinase can be mediated by various signal pathways. For example, the introduction of constitutively active Src mutant can promote phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Oikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hoshino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). PI3K activation at integrin-mediated adhesions can trigger the production of PI(3,4,5)P3 and plays an essential role in the formation of podosomes (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Class 1 myosins are known to play important roles in regulating lipid signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization on the plasma membrane (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh and Ostap, 2016</xref>). Mammalian class 1 myosins are membrane-associated motor proteins and consist of eight different members (Myo1a to Myo1h; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">McConnell and Tyska, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">McIntosh and Ostap, 2016</xref>). All myosin1s contain the conserved large ATPase motor domain (head domain) at the amino terminus that can move along actin filaments by hydrolyzing ATP. The tail domains at the carboxy terminus of myosin1s vary among isoforms and contain functional motifs for lipid and protein interactions (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Krendel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Yu and Bement, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The neck domain between the head and tail domains contains IQ motifs for calmodulin binding and motor regulation (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Among all myosin1 isoforms, Myo1e is the only long-tail isoform that is ubiquitously expressed. Myo1f is the other long-tail isoform with 82% sequence similarity to Myo1e and mainly expresses in hematopoietic cell lineages. The long tail of Myo1e comprises three tail homology domains, TH1, TH2, and TH3. Whereas TH1 is presented in all myosin1 isoforms and generally contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, actual TH1 sequences between long-tail and short-tail myosin1 isoforms are notably different from each other. TH2 and TH3 are unique domains that follow TH1 in Myo1e&#x02019;s long tail. Unlike other short-tail myosin1 isoforms, Myo1e is uniquely enriched at the podosomes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cervero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Yu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ouderkirk and Krendel, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the role of Myo1e and its C-terminal tail domains at the podosome remains unclear. Here, we reveal the spatial, temporal, and functional role of mammalian Myo1e in podosome-forming Src-transformed fibroblasts (MEF-Src), RAW267.4 macrophages, and A375 melanoma cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Ventral enrichment of Myo1e at the podosome</title><p>To characterize the three-dimensional distribution of Myo1e at the podosome, we employed Src-transformed fibroblast cells as a model system. Unlike short-lived podosomes in macrophages, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells transfected with constitutive activated Src-Y530F (MEF-Src) spontaneously assembled large and long-lived podosome rosettes and arcs. Dense F-actin assembly surrounded by adhesion proteins in MEF-Src was often stable within 5 min. Stable podosome structures allowed us to monitor and analyze the axial distribution and temporal dynamics of various podosome core components. Each core component with a fluorescent protein tag and a reference marker of F-actin were pairwise examined by spinning-disk confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Acquired z-stack images were then analyzed with a home-written ImageJ macro and Matlab code. <italic>MaxZ</italic>, a self-defined parameter presented the axial position with the highest intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that &#x003b2;-actin and F-actin marker (calponin homology domain of utrophin [UtrCH], Lifeact, phalloidin) exhibit similar axial distribution with <italic>MaxZ</italic> values of 400 nm in each podosome (Supplemental Figure S1A). Therefore, F-actin labeled by UtrCH was utilized as the spatial reference to compare the axial distribution of 26 other podosome core components, including Myo1e, &#x003b2;-actin, filament nucleating factors (Arp3, Cortactin, CARMIL1, Coronin1b, N-WASP, Arpin [inhibitory role]), G-actin&#x02013;binding proteins (ABP1, CAP1, WIP, Profilin1), depolymerizing factors (Twinfilin1, Cofilin1, Gelsolin), capping proteins (EPS8, CD2AP, CapZ-beta2, CAPG, TMOD3), and cross-linking proteins (Plastin3, VASP, Mena, Alpha-actinin1, FilaminA, Fascin1; <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Siripala and Welch, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pollard, 2016</xref>). Normalized axial distributions of each podosome core component between 0 and 2 &#x000b5;m were jointly evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref> and Supplemental Figure S1, B and C). While all core components laterally colocalized at the podosome, their axial distributions in the podosomes were distinctly different (Supplemental Figure S2). In particular, we found that Myo1e was enriched at the ventral layer of podosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>), as <italic>MaxZ</italic> of Myo1e was lowest (0.128 &#x000b1; 0.014 &#x003bc;m, SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 53; Supplemental Figure S1C). Filament nucleating factors (such as Arp3) were also located in the lower part of the podosome core. On the other hand, cross-linking and pointed-end capping proteins (such as FilaminA and TMOD3, respectively) were situated in the middle and upper part of the podosome core. The distinct enrichment at the ventral layer of the podosome suggests the close Myo1e&#x02013;plasma membrane interaction at the podosome.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1:</label><caption><p>Myo1e is enriched at the ventral layer of the podosome core.

Spot activation of a 405-nm laser was initiated over a small region away from the podosome. Photoconverted cytosolic mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin can diffuse within the cell and subsequently assemble into the F-actin core at the podosome. The axial distribution of newly converted mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin was then monitored by time-lapse confocal microscopy.

Myo1e E393A (a point mutation in the conserved myosin ATPase motor domain that disrupts the salt bridge between switch I and switch II and destabilizes ATP and actin binding [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Reubold <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>]) was also recruited to the podosome and plasma membrane of filopodia protrusions. However, Myo1e without tail domains (Myo1e &#x02206;tail, 1-650) and Myo1e-TH1 (1-920, TH2 and TH3 removed) were not enriched at the podosome and had weak association to the filopodia protrusions. As the interaction between lipids and Myo1e has been reported previously, we further examined the composition of phosphatidylinositol lipids at the podosome by various PH-domain&#x02013;containing probes. PH domains of BTK and PLC&#x003b4; have been used to specifically monitor the distribution of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2, respectively (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>). We found that PI(3,4,5)P3 not PI(4,5)P2 lipids were enriched at the ventral layer of the podosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, B and C</xref>). As F-actin assembly and podosome formation took place, the PI(3,4,5)P3 level visualized by PH-BTK was gradually increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, D and E</xref>, and Supplemental Movie 2). Both catalytic and regulatory subunits of class I PI3K were found at the podosome (Supplemental Figure S3, A and B). On the other hand, the PI(4,5)P2 level, visualized by PH-PLC&#x003b4;, was slightly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>), and PIP5KI &#x003b3;661 was not enriched at the podosome core (Supplemental Figure S3C). While both levels of Myo1e and PH-BTK rose progressively during the podosome formation (Supplemental Figure S3, D and E), we tested whether the recruitment of Myo1e at the podosome was dependent on PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids. PTEN (a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate 3-phosphatase) and SHIP2 (a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase) are phosphatases of PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids and can promote the generation of PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4)P2, respectively (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dyson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). When we overexpressed SHIP2 in MEF-Src, the enrichment level of Myo1e at the podosome core became significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2, F and G</xref>, and Supplemental Figure S3, F and G). Overexpression of PTEN also resulted in reductions of Myo1e enrichment (Supplemental Figure S3G).

Multiple podosomes were often found in each macrophage cell. Myo1e was localized with F-actin at the core of each podosome and surrounded by integrin adaptor proteins, such as paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). F-actin assembly of macrophage podosomes usually have a lifetime of 50&#x02013;200 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref> and Supplemental Movie 5).

The regulation of F-actin polymerization plays a critical role in podosome assembly. Here, we quantitatively examine axial distributions of F-actin&#x02013;binding proteins and regulators at the podosome. Among all 26 actin regulators we have examined, we find that long-tailed Myo1e is uniquely enriched at the ventral layer of the podosome. We also utilize photoconversions of cytosolic mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin to reveal the spatial-temporal incorporation of newly converted &#x003b2;-actin into a preexisting podosome core. We find that F-actin polymerization takes place in the ventral layer of the podosome. Previous studies have reported that Myo1e interacts with actin filament nucleating factors N-WASP/WIP complexes and uncapping protein CARMIL (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Edwards <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). Our previous work also indicated that Myo1e guides F-actin assembly inside the lamellipodia during the cell spreading process (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). The axial distribution analysis of podosome core components reveals the molecular organization at different layers of the podosome. In particular, we compare various actin regulators in groups, such as G-actin&#x02013;binding, filament nucleating, capping, depolymerizing, and cross-linking (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Siripala and Welch, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pollard, 2016</xref>). At the ventral layer of the podosome, actin filament nucleating (Arp3, CARMIL, cortactin, and WIP) barbed-end capping (EPS8, CD2AP, and CapZ-beta2) are markedly enriched. Likewise, pointed-end capping protein TMOD3 is spatially enriched in the apical region of the F-actin core in the podosome. Disparate distributions of barbed-end capping and pointed-end capping proteins confirm the proximity of barbed-end filaments to the plasma membrane and overall orientations of pointed-end filaments toward the cytosol. Along with the ventral assembly of F-actin at the podosome, our observations suggest that Myo1e is positioned as the building block of signal transductions between the plasma membrane and F-actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6G</xref>).</p><p>Myo1e without the tail domain (Myo1e &#x02206;tail, 1-650) and Myo1e-TH1 (1-920) fail to localize to the podosome. Tail domains of long-tailed Myo1e exhibit important roles in various cellular processes, including membrane interaction and adhesion formation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Krendel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Heim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). In all myosin1 isoforms, the tail domain is believed to play important roles in membrane association and ATP-insensitive F-actin binding (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Brzeska <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The membrane association of TH1 has been validated in short-tailed (such as Myo1c; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hokanson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>) and nonmammalian myosin1 isoforms (<italic>Dictyostelium</italic> myosin IE; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). However, our data indicate that TH1 of mammalian Myo1e is not sufficient for membrane association. TH2 and TH3 domains are unique features in long-tailed myosin1 and are absent in other short-tailed myosin1 isoforms. TH2 of long-tailed myosin-I is shown to bind to F-actin in an ATP-independent manner (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Hammer, 1994</xref>), and loss of TH2 may potentially cause the misfolding of TH1 (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). TH3 of Myo1e contains a SH3 domain to facilitate protein&#x02013;protein interactions (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Krendel <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, TH2 and TH3 are not associated to the plasma membrane, either.</p><p>It is reported that negatively charged lipids, such as 2% of PI(4,5)P2 or 2% of PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids can recruit the tail domain TH123 of mammalian Myo1e to the model membrane vesicle in vitro (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Feeser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). Our data further indicate that the combination of TH1 and TH2 (TH12) is the functional unit for membrane association. Mutations of K772A and R782A of TH12 result in the dissociation from the plasma membrane. Removing PI(4,5)P2 lipids by <italic>m</italic>-3M3FBS causes TH12 to dissociate from the plasma membrane. In addition, production of PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids by EGF stimulation promote TH12 enrichment to the plasma membrane. These observations indicate that TH12 of Myo1e can associate with the plasma membrane via both PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids. Nevertheless, PI(3,4,5)P3, not PI(4,5)P2 lipids are progressively enriched during the podosome formation. It is known that SHIP2 can dephosphorylate the 5 position (D5) of the inositol head group of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(4,5)P2 lipids, and PTEN can dephosphorylate at the 3 position (D3) of the inositol head group of of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 lipids. Dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids by SHIP2 or PTEN results in the reduction of Myo1e enrichment at the podosome. It appears that PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids are the key phosphatidylinositol species responsible for Myo1e recruitment at the podosome. Further investigations reveal that TH12 serves as the key domain of Myo1e to interact with the plasma membrane and exhibits similar spatiotemporal characteristics at the podosome, including ventral enrichment, slow recovery dynamics after photobleaching, and membrane-proximal localization. Lipid-binding mutant Myo1e KR2A may be recruited to the podosome via TH2 (F-actin binding) or TH3 (SH3-PRD protein interaction), as it lacks the characteristics of ventral-proximal distribution and slow FRAP dynamics at the podosome.</p><p>Negatively charged lipids, such as PI(3,4,5)P3 can serve as an upstream signal to activate N-WASP and Cdc42 (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Insall and Weiner, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Papayannopoulos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), which trigger Arp2/3-mediated F-actin polymerization at the ventral layer of the podosome. As TH12-expressing MEF-Src cells often lack stable podosome arcs/rosettes, we hypothesize that overexpression of TH12 interferes with F-actin polymerization by competing local PI(3,4,5)P3-mediated signals. Indeed, we find that the levels of PH-BTK (a PI(3,4,5)P3 probe) and N-WASP are negatively correlated with TH12 expression, but not the lipid-binding mutant TH12 KR2A. Likewise, in the initial phase of podosome formation, TH12, not TH12 KR2A, precedes F-actin polymerization factor N-WASP and Arp3. The antagonized fluctuations between TH12 and F-actin polymerization factors suggest their competition for upstream PI(3,4,5)P3-mediated signals that are essential for podosome formation.</p><p>In agreement with the inhibitory characteristics of TH12 in MEF-Src, TH12 expression also blocks the podosome formation in RAW264.7 macrophages and suppresses the gelatin degradation and migration speed in A375 melanoma cells. TH123, which comprises TH12 and TH3, has been demonstrated to interact with various proline-rich domain (PRD) containing proteins, such as WIP and N-WASP (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Geli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). While WIP and N-WASP can promote F-actin polymerization, expression of TH123 still suppresses the podosome formation in MEF-Src. On the other hand, overexpression of full-length Myo1e does not suppress podosome formation. Those results suggest additional factors to regulate TH12 domain, such as binding-inhibition partners or intramolecular conformational changes (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ishikawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It is known that the SH3P2 can bind to Myo1e tail and inhibit the Myo1e recruitment to the tip of lamellipodia (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tanimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). The interaction of SH3P2 and TH12 remains to be investigated. Interactions between the motor domain and the cortical F-actin network on the plasma membrane are also speculated, as full-length Myo1e remains at the plasma membrane after <italic>m</italic>-3M3FBS treatment. The additional coupling with F-actin of full-length Myo1e may cause intramolecular conformational changes and alter the interaction between TH12 and the plasma membrane.</p><p>The expression and mutation of Myo1e have been linked to various diseases. The high expression level of Myo1e is associated with the decreased survival in patients with basal breast cancer (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hallett <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Knockdown of Myo1e in the mouse fibroblast results in the slower migration and unstable cell-matrix adhesions (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Gupta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Tanimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). While knockout of Myo1e does not block tumor formation in the mouse model, loss of Myo1e delays breast tumor progression and suppresses lung metastasis (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ouderkirk-Pecone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In addition, Myo1e-knockout mice lose the junctional integrity in the kidney podocyte cells (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Mutations of Myo1e have been discovered in various human diseases related to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, including mutations at A159P, T119I, and Y695X (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mele <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Hamed <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Podocytes with Myo1e mutations exhibit disruptions of membrane integrity in the glomerulus and cause protein leakages into the urine. While A159P and T119I mutations are within the motor domain, Y695X mutation results in loss of Myo1e tail domain. Here, our study reveals the mechanistic role of Myo1e tail domains in orchestrating the lipid-cytoskeleton interaction. We find that Myo1e is stably enriched at the ventral layer of the podosome and interacts with PI(3,4,5)P3 lipids via its TH12 domain. Further studies are required to extend these findings to other physiological functions of Myo1e, including motor activation, cargo recognition, and adhesion regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>RPTP&#x003b1;<sup>+/+</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) was a gift from Jan Sap, New York University.

An F-actin channel was used to define the region of interest (ROI) of the podosome core via Wand tool (ImageJ) or Spot function (Imaris), and mean intensities of other channels within the ROI were measured accordingly. Mean intensities of camera background were measured in the area without cells, and mean intensities of cytosol background were measured in the cytosolic region away from the podosome. Kymographs were generated via the Reslice function in ImageJ. Volocity software (Perkin-Elmer) was used to create three-dimensional views (<italic>xy</italic>, <italic>xz</italic>, and <italic>yz</italic>) of z-stack images taken by a spinning-disk confocal microscope. The <italic>xz</italic> and <italic>yz</italic> views represent the cross-section of the podosome arc at the boxed region.

Images from 0 to 2 &#x000b5;m above the adhesion plane were used for the axial distribution analysis. An F-actin channel was used as the reference channel to identify podosomes. To compare different podosome components, acquired data sets were realigned by a home-written Matlab code so that the maximum fluorescence intensity in the F-actin channel was fixed at 400 nm above the adhesion plane. The z-stack image of F-actin at 400 nm above the substrate was used to define the ROI at the podosome core. Using a home-written ImageJ macro, mean intensities of the other podosome component within the ROI at all z-positions were measured respectively. After background subtraction, normalized axial distributions of each podosome component were plotted by GraphPad Prism. A self-defined parameter, <italic>MaxZ</italic>, represented the axial position of the highest intensity and was used to compare the axial distribution of each podosome component.</p></sec><sec><title>Photoconversion of cytosolic mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin</title><p>MEF-Src cells were transfected with mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin and pLifeAct-miRFP703 and imaged by a spinning-disk confocal microscope with a FRAP module (PhotoKinesis Unit, Perkin-Elmer Ultraview VoX). Photoswitchable mEOS2 changes the fluorescence excitation/emission spectrum upon 405-nm laser activation. mEOS excitation/emission peaks are 505/516 nm before activation and become 569/581 nm after activation. Before spot activation, preconverted mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actins within the cell were photobleached by a 561-nm laser. Then, spot activation of a 405-nm laser was initiated over a small cytosolic region away from the podosome arc or other preexisting F-actin structures. After spot activation, a time-lapsed confocal image acquisition of a 561-nm channel with 200-nm z-step and 5-s interval was used to monitor the distribution of photoconverted mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin in a preexisting podosome. As F-actin continues to polymerize at the podosome, newly converted mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin away from the podosome can diffuse within the cytosol and then be assembled into F-actin structures at the different layers of the podosome core. The mean intensities of photoconverted mEOS2-&#x003b2;-actin within the ROI (podosome core, defined by pLifeAct-miRFP703) at each z position over time were measured by ImageJ software.
