The mesenchymal mode of cancer cell invasion is mediated by elongated membrane protrusions driven by the assembly of branched F-actin networks. How deregulation of actin regulators promotes cancer cell invasion is still enigmatic. We report that increased expression and membrane localization of the actin regulator Lamellipodin correlate with reduced metastasis-free survival and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. In agreement, we find that Lamellipodin depletion reduced lung metastasis in an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model. Invasive 3D cancer cell migration as well as invadopodia formation and matrix degradation was impaired upon Lamellipodin depletion. Mechanistically, we show that Lamellipodin promotes invasive 3D cancer cell migration via both actin-elongating Ena/VASP proteins and the Scar/WAVE complex, which stimulates actin branching. In contrast, Lamellipodin interaction with Scar/WAVE but not with Ena/VASP is required for random 2D cell migration. We identified a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that regulates selective recruitment of these effectors to Lamellipodin: Abl-mediated Lamellipodin phosphorylation promotes its association with both Scar/WAVE and Ena/VASP, whereas Src-dependent phosphorylation enhances binding to Scar/WAVE but not to Ena/VASP. Through these selective, regulated interactions Lamellipodin mediates directional sensing of epidermal growth factor (EGF) gradients and invasive 3D migration of breast cancer cells. Our findings imply that increased Lamellipodin levels enhance Ena/VASP and Scar/WAVE activities at the plasma membrane to promote 3D invasion and metastasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer metastasis is one of the leading causes of cancer-associated mortality in women worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> Metastasis is a multistep process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> After breaching, the basement membrane metastasizing cancer cells migrate through the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumor stroma in order to intravasate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> Carcinoma cells that migrate in a mesenchymal mode form elongated membrane protrusions driven by the assembly of branched F-actin networks.

Therefore, we analyzed publicly available data sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> to examine whether Lpd mRNA levels correlated with occurrence of distant metastases in breast cancer patients. Lpd was overexpressed in several types of breast tumors compared with matched healthy tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). High levels of Lpd mRNA correlated with reduced metastasis-free and disease-free survival of breast cancer patients in three separate cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 1B and C</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup> In addition, we explored whether Lpd protein expression levels correlate with clinical outcome for breast cancer patients by staining a tumor microarray (TMA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> generated from 312 patients with invasive breast cancer with anti-Lpd antibodies. Moderately, but not highly, increased abundance of Lpd in the cytoplasm (Histoscore 2; Hazard ratio (HR) (95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI)): 1.765 (1.026&#x02013;3.036); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 1D and 2A,B</xref>) and at the plasma membrane (Histoscore 2: HR, (95&#x00025; CI): 2.231 (1.26&#x02013;3.949); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1d and e</xref>; compared with respective histoscore 1) was significantly associated with increased risk for breast cancer-associated mortality. Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation between Lpd intensity at the plasma membrane and Her2 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with Lpd's predominant role at the plasma membrane in promoting cell motility and migration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> we observed a significant association between highly, but not moderately, increased Lpd staining intensity at the plasma membrane and reduced disease-free (Histoscore 3: HR (95&#x00025; CI): 1.652 (1.24&#x02013;2.428)) and metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients (Histoscore 3: HR (95&#x00025; CI): 1.515 (1.054&#x02013;2.178); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> compared with respective histoscore 1).</p><p>To investigate the requirement for Lpd in metastasis, we tested the effect of reducing Lpd expression in MDA-MB-231-LM2 cells (further referred to as LM2), a highly metastatic derivative of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> on their ability to metastasize from an orthotopic mammary tumor to the lungs. We generated stable LM2 cell lines with two independent Lpd-targeting shRNAs or a non-targeting control shRNA, all three retroviruses also conferring the cis-linked marker ZsGreen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). Lpd knockdown and control cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. Primary tumors formed 6 weeks after injection from Lpd-deficient cells were similar in size to those arising from control LM2 cells, suggesting that the loss of Lpd did not affect primary tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Importantly, only 3 out of 20 mice bearing Lpd-depleted tumors developed macroscopic lung metastases, compared with 9 out of 10 control tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In addition, animals with tumors generated from Lpd-depleted cells that metastasized displayed significantly reduced numbers of pulmonary ZsGreen-positive metastases compared with the metastatic burden of animals with control tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c and d</xref>).</p><p>We then explored whether Lpd promotes cancer cell invasion during metastasis. In fixed samples, tumors generated from control shRNA LM2 cells prominently invaded the surrounding stroma. However, tumors from Lpd knockdown cells were markedly less invasive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We investigated Lpd function in cancer invasion in more detail by intravital imaging. Compared with control shRNA LM2 tumors, Lpd knockdown tumors had fewer motile cells, which migrated less directionally and extended protrusions less frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2f&#x02013;i</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Video 1</xref>), indicating that Lpd is required for invasive cancer cell phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To examine Lpd-driven breast cancer intravasation and dissemination, we implanted fluorescently labeled MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells into the perivitelline cavities of zebrafish embryos. In this assay, the injected cancer cells intravasate, and then infiltrate the trunk of the fish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> Overexpression of GFP-Lpd in MDA-MB-231 cells enhanced the frequency of seeding of these breast cancer cells compared with GFP-expressing control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2j and k</xref>). We then performed tail vein injections of the Lpd knockdown and control LM2 cell lines into immunocompromised mice and quantified lung metastases after 28 days to test whether Lpd influenced the later stages of the metastatic cascade. Lpd depletion did not reduce the number of metastatic foci in the lungs of the mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 2D and E</xref>). Taken together, our results reveal that Lpd promotes local tumor invasion, intravasation and metastasis <italic>in vivo,</italic> but is not required for extravasation.</p><p>Breast cancer cell migration toward blood vessels is guided by cues from the tumor microenvironment, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> We reasoned that the effect of Lpd depletion on EGF-induced 3D invasion might arise from defects in lamellipodial dynamics. Depletion of Lpd in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells decreased lamellipodia size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>), similar to B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells, in which Lpd depletion also reduces protrusion speed under steady-state conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> EGF-stimulated MDA-MB-231 Lpd knockdown cells displayed reduced protrusion persistence and distance, without affecting protrusion speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). We chose MTLn3 cells, a mammary adenocarcinoma cancer cell line, in which protrusion responses to EGF have been extensively characterized, to examine EGF-elicited protrusion in more detail as lamellipodial size is least affected by Lpd knockdown in this cell line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). In agreement with our findings in MDA-MB-231 cells, in EGF-stimulated MTLn3 cells reduced Lpd levels significantly decreased protrusion persistence and distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a and b</xref>) but did not affect protrusion speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>), compared with controls. Lpd was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of serum-starved cells, but was rapidly recruited to the cell edge following bath application of EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3c and d</xref>). Lamellipodial initiation was detected 30&#x02009;s after EGF stimulation in Ctrl-shRNA-expressing cells but was delayed significantly when Lpd levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b, e and f</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Video 3</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that, in breast cancer cells, Lpd depletion reduces EGF-elicited lamellipodial protrusion formation and persistence, but not speed.</p><p>Membrane extension during lamellipodial protrusion is driven by actin polymerization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> To determine how Lpd depletion influences actin polymerization, we used a G-actin incorporation assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> to measure the abundance and distribution of polymerization-competent, free (uncapped) F-actin barbed-ends in lamellipodia of living cells. Silencing of Lpd significantly reduced free barbed-end formation 1&#x02009;min after EGF stimulation, relative to Ctrl-shRNA-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4a and b</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that Lpd promotes lamellipodial protrusion by increasing actin polymerization downstream of EGFR activation.</p><p>EGF-dependent membrane protrusion in MTLn3 cells requires Ena/VASP proteins and Arp2/3-mediated dendritic nucleation;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> and Lpd binds both Ena/VASP proteins and the Arp2/3 activating Scar/WAVE complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Consistent with this, membrane recruitment of Mena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4c and d</xref>) and Arp2/3 complex to the protruding edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4e and f</xref>) was significantly reduced in Lpd-depleted cells after EGF stimulation.</p><p>We hypothesized that the requirement for Lpd in EGF-induced protrusion reflects Lpd-mediated initiation of chemotactic responses. The initial step of chemotaxis is directional sensing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> We used a micropipette to generate a spatially restricted EGF gradient. Ctrl-shRNA MTLn3 cells formed new protrusions toward the pipette, demonstrating their ability to sense the EGF gradient. However, those of Lpd-reduced cells were random relative to the micropipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4g and h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 4A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Video 5</xref>). Chemotactic indices confirmed the lack of directional bias in Lpd-deficient MTLn3 protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>), highlighting an essential role for Lpd in the initial steps of chemotaxis toward EGF.</p><p>Lpd is concentrated at the edges of lamellipodia that protrude in response to uniform EGF stimulation. Correlative differential interference contrast microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging in live cells revealed enrichment of Lpd at the edges of cells oriented toward the micropipettes containing EGF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>), confirming that Lpd was enriched in membranes exposed to the highest concentration of the EGF gradient and supporting a function for Lpd in linking gradient sensing to directed membrane protrusion.</p><p>We hypothesized that EGF chemosensing might involve Lpd-mediated recruitment of Ena/VASP proteins. We tested whether Lpd-depleted cells, expressing either a GFP-Lpd or an Lpd mutant in which all Ena/VASP binding sites had been rendered non-functional by mutation (GFP-Lpd<sup>EVmut</sup>), could respond to EGF gradients in the micropipette assay and discovered that, while GFP-Lpd effectively rescued the chemosensing defects in Lpd-depleted cells, GFP-Lpd<sup>EVmut</sup> conferred no significant phenotypic rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 5C</xref>). In line with this finding, a function-perturbing approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> revealed that Ena/VASP proteins were required for chemosensing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 5A and B</xref>). Thus, extension of lamellipodia toward EGF during chemosensing by breast carcinoma cells requires the Lpd-dependent recruitment of Ena/VASP proteins, despite the dispensability of Ena/VASP for Lpd-driven random 2D cell migration.</p><p>We next analyzed the requirements for Lpd during EGF-dependent 3D invasion. In 3D inverted chemotaxis assays toward EGF with MDA-MB-231 or SUM-159 invasive breast cancer lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> knockdown of Lpd significantly decreased invasion through matrigel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>) and collagen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 6B&#x02013;D</xref>) compared with control shRNA expressing cells. Conversely, Lpd overexpression significantly increased invasion toward EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d and e</xref>).</p><p>As invasion is known to be partially dependent on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) digestion of ECM, we tested whether Lpd increases invasion via MMP-dependent or migration-dependent mechanisms. MMP inhibitor treatment of GFP-expressing control cells reduced invasion, as expected. Similarly, MMP inhibitor treatment reduced invasion of Lpd overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. However, Lpd overexpressing cells treated with MMP inhibitors invaded significantly further compared with GFP control cells treated with the inhibitor, suggesting that Lpd functions to increase invasion by increasing migration and potentially MMP-dependent ECM degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>The aforementioned findings prompted us to investigate Lpd's role in MMP-dependent degradation. Carcinoma cells can utilize protrusive invadopodia, sites of MMP exocytosis, to invade through the basement membrane and ECM-rich interstitial stroma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> We observed that Lpd co-localized with the invadopodial marker cortactin at invadopodia, at sites of matrix degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Previously, we reported that Mena promotes invadopodium stabilization and matrix degradation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> and here we observed that Lpd depletion appeared to reduce the amount of Mena within invadopodia considerably, potentially reflecting a role for Lpd in Mena recruitment to invadopodia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 6H</xref>). Silencing of Lpd in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased the number of precursors, mature invadopodia and the total number of invadopodia in comparison with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5i and j</xref>). Furthermore, Lpd-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited a significant decrease in their ability to degrade matrix relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5g and h</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Lpd is required for invadopodial precursor formation or for both precursor formation and subsequent stabilization/maturation, and for invadopodia-mediated matrix degradation.</p><p>To test the relative contribution of Lpd interactions with Ena/VASP proteins or with the Scar/WAVE complex during MDA-MB-231 3D invasion, we overexpressed a panel of Lpd mutants in which all Ena/VASP (GFP-Lpd<sup>EVmut</sup>), all Scar/WAVE-binding sites (GFP-Lpd<sup>S/Wmut</sup>), or all Ena/VASP and all Scar/WAVE-binding sites (GFP-Lpd<sup>EV&#x0002b;S/Wmut</sup>) had been mutated. All of these mutants localized to the leading edge of MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 6F and G</xref>). At steady state when embedded in 3D matrigel, MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing GFP-Lpd displayed significantly more protrusions, which protruded faster compared with GFP control cells. However, expression of Lpd-Ena/VASP-, Lpd-Scar/WAVE- and double-binding mutants all failed to increase protrusion numbers and speed (Figure 7h and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 7G</xref>). Similarly, these mutants did not support invasion through matrigel toward EGF, suggesting that Lpd promotes 3D chemotactic invasion via both Ena/VASP and Scar/WAVE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d and e</xref>). These findings, combined with our previous observation that Lpd interaction with Scar/WAVE but not with Ena/VASP is required for random 2D migration, prompted us to hypothesize that interactions between Lpd and these actin regulators may be differentially regulated.</p><p>Previously, we found that Lpd is phosphorylated by Abl kinases upon growth factor stimulation, and this positively regulates its interaction with Ena/VASP proteins and their recruitment to the leading edge of cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> As Src kinases are also activated upon growth factor stimulation and increased Src activity promotes cancer cell invasion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> we explored whether Lpd interactions with downstream partners are regulated by Src phosphorylation.</p><p>We expressed GFP-Lpd with wild-type c-Src or a kinase-inactive mutant of c-Src and, after immunoprecipitation of Lpd, observed that it was tyrosine phosphorylated in cells expressing wild-type but not kinase-inactive c-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Both Src and Abl kinases are activated downstream of growth factor receptors, and Src phosphorylation of Abl kinases contributes to their activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> To distinguish between Src and Abl phosphorylation of Lpd and to investigate whether endogenous Lpd is phosphorylated by Src tyrosine kinases, we made use of Abl/Arg double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> After PDGF-BB stimulation, Lpd was robustly tyrosine phosphorylated in the absence of both Abl kinases, Abl and Arg. This was blocked by the Src inhibitor Bosutinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6b and c</xref>), indicating that Src kinase activity leads to Lpd phosphorylation upon growth factor receptor activation.</p><p>We first investigated whether Src phosphorylation controls Lpd-Ena/VASP interaction, since this is positively regulated by Abl phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Surprisingly, c-Src-induced Lpd phosphorylation did not affect Lpd-Ena/VASP binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 7A and B</xref>). In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation between GFP-Lpd and Myc-tagged Scar/WAVE complex revealed that significantly more Scar/WAVE complex co-precipitated with Lpd when either c-Src or c-Abl was co-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6d&#x02013;g</xref>). We also tested whether the interaction between endogenous Lpd and Scar/WAVE is positively regulated by c-Src by using ectopically expressed GST-tagged Abi (which reduces endogenous Abi and thereby replaces it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup>) to efficiently pull down the Scar/WAVE complex and associated proteins. GST-Abi pulldowns from cells co-expressing GFP-Src contained higher levels of endogenous Scar/WAVE2 co-precipitating with endogenous Lpd compared with GFP controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 7C and D</xref>). Conversely, GST-Abi pulldowns from cells co-expressing GFP-Src treated with the c-Src inhibitor (KB SRC 4) contained lower levels of endogenous Scar/WAVE2 co-precipitating with endogenous Lpd compared with GST-Abi pulldowns from DMSO-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 7E and F</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the Lpd-Ena/VASP interaction is regulated by c-Abl phosphorylation, whereas the Lpd-Scar/WAVE interaction is positively regulated by both c-Abl and c-Src-dependent phosphorylation.</p><p>To better understand this differential regulation, we identified potential direct c-Src phosphorylation sites in Lpd, using purified c-Src kinase to phosphorylate an immobilized peptide array covering all putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Lpd. This analysis revealed that Lpd harbors two robustly and four weakly phosphorylated c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We have previously mapped eight c-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation sites in Lpd,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> which partly overlap with these newly identified c-Src sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). To verify that the Lpd phosphorylation sites identified <italic>in vitro</italic> were phosphorylated in cells, we mutated the tyrosines in the six c-Src (GFP-Lpd<sup>Y6F</sup>) and the eight c-Abl phosphorylation sites (GFP-Lpd<sup>Y8F</sup>) to phenylalanine, rendering them non-phosphorylatable. Overexpression of GFP-Lpd induced low levels of Lpd tyrosine phosphorylation, which was markedly enhanced by stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5&#x02009;min. In contrast, neither GFP-Lpd<sup>Y6F</sup> nor GFP-Lpd<sup>Y8F</sup> tyrosine phosphorylation was enhanced when cells expressing these constructs were stimulated with EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7b and c</xref>). We found that the GFP-Lpd<sup>Y6F</sup> and GFP-Lpd<sup>Y8F</sup> mutants interacted significantly less with the Scar/WAVE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7f and g</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 8D</xref>). Nevertheless, GFP-Lpd<sup>Y6F</sup> and -Lpd<sup>Y8F</sup> mutants localized to the leading edge of MDA-MB-231 cells similar to wild-type Lpd (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 6F and G</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that full-length Lpd can be phosphorylated at these sites in cells upon EGFR activation, likely as a consequence of activated Abl and Src kinases.</p><p>To verify that both Src and Abl kinases are required for breast cancer invasion toward EGF, we tested the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells with and without incubation with the Src and Abl inhibitors Dasatinib or STI571.

Lpd function in metastasis may be mediated via both Ena/VASP and the Scar/WAVE complex since we observed that Lpd mediates breast cancer invasion via both actin effectors.

This differential regulation of Lpd-Ena/VASP or Lpd-Scar/WAVE recruitment may allow Lpd to fine-tune actin cytoskeletal dynamics via Ena/VASP-mediated actin filament elongation and Scar/WAVE-Arp2/3-mediated nucleation/branching, consistent with the context-dependent differential requirements for these interactions we observed. Lpd-driven random 2D cell migration requires Scar/WAVE, but not Ena/VASP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> Lpd-dependent chemosensing in 2D requires Ena/VASP, and interactions with both SCAR/WAVE and Ena/VASP are required for 3D chemotaxis and migration.

Affinity purified polyclonal rabbit Lpd antibody in PBS (1:250) (32&#x02009;min, room temperature) was used. Slides counterstained with hematoxylin II and bluing reagent (Ventana Medical) (4&#x02009;min each), dehydrated: 1 &#x000d7; 70&#x00025; IMS, 1&#x02009;min, 2 &#x000d7; 100&#x00025; IMS, 1.5&#x02009;min, 3 &#x000d7; xylene, 1&#x02009;min, mounted (Eukitt) and imaged (Leica microscope, &#x000d7; 40).</p><p>Intensity of Lpd in cytoplasm and membrane assessed on TMAs using weighted histoscore (H-Score) method: intensity in majority of cells assessed as negative and weak (1), or moderate and strong (2), then multiplied by the percentage of cells within this category. The weighted histoscore: 0&#x02013;200 divided into thirtiles: Cytoplasma: histoscore 1 (0&#x02013;88.75), histoscore 2 (88.75&#x02013;170) and histoscore 3 (170&#x02013;200); Membrane: histoscore 1 (0&#x02013;25), histoscore 2 (25&#x02013;95) and histoscore 3 (95&#x02013;200). TMAs were assessed by two independent observers (UP and CG). Intensity scores that varied by more than a factor of one or a proportion by more than 20&#x00025; were jointly reassessed and consensus reached. For all other cases, the mean score was used. Disease-specific survival curves generated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare statistically significant differences between subgroups. Univariate and multivariate analyses Cox proportional hazards regression models used to evaluate overall and breast cancer-specific death by histoscore of Lpd intensity in cytoplasm and at membrane. All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Study approval</title><p>The study approval was obtained for TMA from NHS Research Ethics Committee, King's Health Partners Cancer Biobank, London, UK.
