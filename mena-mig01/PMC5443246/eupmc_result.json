    "Psoriasin, which is also known as S100A7, is a member of the S100 protein family, a group of calcium-responsive signalling proteins. Psoriasin expression remains high in patients with psoriasis, whereas it is downregulated in patients with invasive breast carcinoma. This observation suggests that this protein may be a notable marker of keratinocyte function and differentiation during wound healing. The aim of the present study was to determine the cellular impact of Psoriasin in keratinocytes, which are the primary cell type associated with wound healing. Psoriasin expression in wound tissues was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunochemical staining. Knockdown of Psoriasin in HaCaT cells was performed using anti-Psoriasin ribozyme transgenes and the effect on growth, adhesion and migration of keratinocytes was subsequently determined using in vitro cellular functional assays. Psoriasin expression is upregulated in wounds, particularly at the wound edges. The present study demonstrated that Psoriasin is expressed in keratinocytes and is a fundamental regulator of keratinocyte migration. Significant increases in the rate of keratinocyte adhesion, migration and growth were observed in Psoriasin-deficient cells (P<0.01 vs. control). Application of small inhibitors identified the potential association of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, focal adhesion primase and rho-associated protein kinase signalling pathways with Psoriasin-regulated cell adhesion and motility. In conclusion, Psoriasin serves an important role in the wound healing process, suggesting that it may be utilized as a potential wound healing biomarker."
