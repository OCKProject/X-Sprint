Deficiency of &#x003b1;II-spectrin can also affect the complex mechanism of in vitro capillary tube formation, as demonstrated in a model of angiogenesis. Live imaging revealed that impairment of capillary tube assembly was mainly associated with a significant decrease in cell projection length and stability. &#x003b1;II-spectrin depletion is also associated with significantly decreased expression of three proteins involved in capillary tube formation and assembly: VE-cadherin, MCAM and &#x003b2;3-integrin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par4">Our data confirm the role of &#x003b1;II-spectrin in the control of cell adhesion and spreading.

Many studies on RBC, particularly analyses of mutations causing hereditary hemolytic anemia, have defined the importance of this network for maintaining cell shape and membrane integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The fundamental member of this network, spectrin, is thought to be present in all metazoan cells. In non-erythroid cells, it also occurs in endomembranes of the nucleus, cytoplasmic vesicles and the Golgi complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that similar spectrin-based structures participate in both the establishment and maintenance of many highly specialized membrane domains that enable the cell to execute a variety of physiological functions, including morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In mammalian RBCs, spectrins mainly occur as large and flexible heterotetramers made of a set of two &#x003b1;I and two &#x003b2;I subunits. These tetramers, as basic filaments of the network, cross-link short actin filaments via the actin-binding domain present in &#x003b2;-spectrins. In nucleated cells, there are a large number of possible combinations of spectrin isoforms. They are expressed from two genes that code &#x003b1;-spectrins (&#x003b1;I and &#x003b1;II subunits) and five that code &#x003b2;-spectrins (&#x003b2;I through &#x003b2;V subunits) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The occurrence of the spectrin-based skeleton in various cellular environments and its interaction with multiple proteins indicate that spectrin plays a role in many different physiological pathways involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Some studies show that spectrin is essential for normal embryogenesis and organ development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. For example, &#x003b1;II-spectrin appears to be a key component in cell spreading, tissue control and organ development in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cortical &#x003b2;(H)-spectrin is directly involved in the function of sosie, which an essential gene for oogenesis. Dysfunction of sosie in the germ and soma cell lines of <italic>Drosophila</italic> leads to defective organization of cytoplasmic actin networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Our recent studies also confirmed the contribution of &#x003b1;II-spectrin in cell adhesion processes and in organization of the actin cytoskeleton in various cell models. siRNA-mediated depletion of &#x003b1;II-spectrin in a melanoma cell line revealed defects in cell adhesion, such as changes in actin stress fibers, modification of focal adhesion and altered levels of some integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Such alterations have also been observed in embryonic fibroblasts from &#x003b1;II-spectrin<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In human neuroblastoma cells, depletion of &#x003b1;II-spectrin causes loss of adhesive properties in cell bodies and neurites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, spectrin may also regulate the function and development of actin-rich, dynamic invadosomes by controlling the mobility of the integrins in the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the regulatory role of spectrin in cell&#x02013;cell contact and adhesion processes in the first stages of immunological synapse (IS) formation was recently demonstrated. Loss of &#x003b1;II-spectrin was associated with loss of actin-rich lamelipodias in activated T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">In this study, we used different endothelial cell (EC) models to investigate the involvement of &#x003b1;II-spectrin in: cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix; cell motility; and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. We further analyzed the impact of &#x003b1;II-spectrin depletion on the assembly of capillary tubes in vitro to ascertain its role in modulating endothelial migration during angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental procedure</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cell culture</title><p id="Par27">The human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 (ATCC, CRL-10636) was grown in MCDB131 (Gibco) supplemented with 15% FCS (FCS PAN Biotech), 2&#x02009;mM&#x02009;L-glutamine, 1&#x02009;&#x003bc;g of dexamethasone (D8893, Sigma) and 100&#x02009;ng of EGF (Invitrogen).
