the cellular and molecular pathways that create a tumor promoting microenvironment. The myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88 acts as a main adaptor molecule for the signaling cascades initiated from Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R). MyD88 has been shown to contribute to tumorigenesis in many inflammation-associated cancer models. In this study, we sought to better define the role of MyD88 in neoplastic cells using a murine melanoma model. Herein, we have demonstrated that MyD88 expression is required to maintain the angiogenic switch that supports B16 melanoma growth. By knocking down MyD88 we reduced TLR-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation with no evident effects over cell proliferation and survival. In addition, MyD88 downregulation was associated with a decrease of HIF1&#x003b1; levels and its target gene VEGF, in correlation with an impaired capability to induce capillary sprouting and tube formation of endothelial cells. Melanomas developed from cells lacking MyD88 showed an enhanced secretion of chemoattractant ligands such as CCL2, CXCL10 and CXCL1 and have an improved infiltration of macrophages to the tumor site. Our results imply that cell-autonomous signaling through MyD88 is required to sustain tumor growth and underscore its function as an important positive modulator of tumor angiogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006668</institution-id><institution>Fondo para la Investigaci&#x000f3;n Cient&#x000ed;fica y Tecnol&#x000f3;gica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICT 2013 1068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trucco</surname><given-names>Lucas Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>SECyT-UNC</institution></funding-source><award-id>Res 366/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maccioni</surname><given-names>Mariana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Instituto Nacional del C&#x000e1;ncer-Argentina</institution></funding-source><award-id>Convocatoria 2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maccioni</surname><given-names>Mariana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia-Pr&#x000e9;stamo BID PICT 2011 2657/ PICT 2013 1068 to MM, PIP CONICET 2012/2014 11220110100921, Instituto Nacional del C&#x000e1;ncer Convocatoria 2015 to MM, SECyT-UNC 366/16 to MM.

Upon activation by their respective ligands, these receptors engage MyD88 driving the assembly of a multiprotein signaling complex which ultimately triggers the expression of several genes involved in the pro-inflammatory response [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several lines of evidence have suggested that MyD88 plays an important role in tumor development. In addition, high MyD88 expression was described in several tumors [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and enhanced levels of MyD88 were associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal and ovarian cancers [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Stimulation of TLRs is mediated by pathogen associated molecular patterns including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipopeptides, flagellin, bacterial DNA and viral double-stranded RNA. Besides microbial products, TLRs also binds endogenous, host-derived danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), i.e., molecules that are released or exposed by stressed or dying cells, for example high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), heat shock proteins and &#x003b2;-defensins [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thirteen different TLRs have been characterized in mammals and all TLRs family members transmit signals through MyD88 with the exception of TLR3, which uses the adaptor protein TICAM1 (also known as TRIF). Binding of ligands leads to the dimerization of TLRs and the recruitment of MyD88, which in turn engages different signaling molecules resulting in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and the transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B (p50/p65). Subsequently, these cascades induce the expression of key inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and interleukins IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and IL-8 [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Previous reports have shown that MyD88 contributes to tumorigenesis in many inflammation-associated cancer models. Ablation of MyD88 impairs intestinal tumor formation induced by the administration of the carcinogen azoxymethane and the spontaneous tumor development in mice with heterozygous mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene, as well as diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis associated with a reduced IL-6 production [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Additionally, MyD88 is an essential positive regulator for chemically induced skin papilloma and fibrosarcoma formation [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In contrast, a protective role of MyD88 was described for chronic colitis-associated colon cancer formation and gastric cancer development following infection with <italic>Helicobacter</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, non-inflammatory functions exerted by MyD88 regulate the proliferation, metastasis and chemoresistance of malignant cells. For instance, it was found that MyD88 is required for oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation in fibroblast and keratinocytes, having the IL-1R/MyD88/NF-&#x003ba;B axis a mandatory role in the latter [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also, the TLR4/MyD88 signaling is implicated in the acquisition of paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer and MyD88 inhibition renders colon cancer cell lines susceptible to apoptosis mediated by cisplatin [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the precise mechanisms whereby MyD88 act intrinsically in tumor cells to sustain cancer progression remain poorly understood.</p><p>A growing capillary network is strictly necessary for ensuring sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients in expanding solid tumors. The process of formation of new blood vessels via sprouting or splitting of the pre-existing vasculature, termed angiogenesis, is initiated and controlled by multiple growth factors produced by the cancer cells and the cells from the stromal microenvironment [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among the pro-angiogenic factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is especially important. VEGF is a potent promoter of cell survival, growth and migration of endothelial cells and a key mediator in the angiogenic switch from the avascular to vascular phenotype mainly via the VEGFR2 receptor [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The hypoxic tumor milieu induces the upregulation of VEGF gene expression, mediated by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; (HIF1&#x003b1;), creating a VEGF gradient that provides chemotactic signals for the sprouting of vascular cells [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Stimuli other than oxygen deprivation can also induce HIF1&#x003b1; activity in tumor tissues leading to increases in VEGF in normoxic conditions including oncogenic signaling and loss-of-function mutations in tumor-suppressor genes like <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are other angiogenic factors with documented effects on tumor vessel growth such as members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor, angiopoietin, and transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; families, IL-8 or the VEGF homolog placenta growth factor (PlGF) [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we sought to better define the role of MyD88 in neoplastic cells using a murine melanoma model. We evaluate how MyD88 downregulation influences the proliferation, cell cycle and survival of B16 cells, and its ability to develop tumors when grafted into syngeneic mice. Our results imply that cell-autonomous signaling through MyD88 is required to sustain tumor growth and underscore its function as an important positive modulator for tumor angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Characterization of MyD88-silenced B16 melanoma cells</title><p>According to data available from The Human Protein Atlas, MyD88 protein is highly overexpressed in primary and metastatic cutaneous melanoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179897.g001">Fig 1A&#x02013;1D</xref>), as well as in melanoma derived cell lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org">http://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>) [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This evidence suggests that aberrant elevation of MyD88 expression may have a critical role in maintaining the malignant features in this type of cancer. To investigate the impact of MyD88 intrinsical activity in tumor cells, we used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral vectors to reduce endogenous MyD88 levels in B16 melanoma cells. The B16 cells stably transduced with two independent shRNAs against MyD88 (shMyD88-A and shMyD88-B) showed a strong suppression of MyD88 expression, with &#x0003e;90% and &#x0003e;75% decrease in mRNA and protein levels, respectively, compared with cells transduced with a scrambled shRNA control (SCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179897.g001">Fig 1E&#x02013;1G</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0179897.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0179897.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Stable downregulation of MyD88 in murine melanoma cells.</title><p><bold>(A-B)</bold> Representative immunohistochemistry images of tissue samples from primary and <bold>(C-D)</bold> metastatic human melanomas stained with antiMyD88 antibody (brown).

In order to study the effect of the TLR/MyD88 signaling, cells were stimulated with LPS, an integral glycolipid found in the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria which is recognized and activates TLR4 [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179897.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, no differences in the cell proliferation rates of MyD88-knockdown and SCR cells were observed, neither in basal conditions nor under LPS treatment.

Interestingly, it has been reported that molecular changes in tumor cells that had no apparent impact on their proliferation capacity <italic>in vitro</italic>, had unexpected consequences in the tumor microenvironment <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, when kinases of the Hippo pathway were inactivated in tumor cell lines, their anchorage-independent growth potential <italic>in vitro</italic> was increased but, surprisingly, this inactivation led to a profound inhibition of tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> due to changes in the antitumor immune response [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In this work, we demonstrate that silencing MyD88 in B16 cells, do not alter their proliferation/survival capacity <italic>in vitro</italic> but it inhibits tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. This inhibition seems to be dependent on changes in the balance of chemokines and pro- and anti-angiogenic factors secreted by shMyD88 cells, which in turn elicits a different type of immune infiltration.</p><p>The mechanisms that link inflammatory responses to cancer development remain a subject of intense investigation, emphasizing the need to better understand the cellular and molecular pathways that create a tumor promoting microenvironment. Genetic alterations that cause cellular transformation can also drive the activation of intrinsic inflammation-related programs that leads to the expression of bioactive molecules that facilitate proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this regard, the study of MyD88 adaptor protein and its role in tumorigenesis has gain great interest since it is placed at the crossroad of several signaling routes connecting innate receptors and pro-inflammatory mediators. A clear prerequisite for a tumor to grow is to acquire the ability to stimulate neovascularization by shifting the balance between positive and negative angiogenic regulators. Fast growing malignant cells produce cytokines and enzymes that induce the proliferation and migration of surrounding endothelial cells allowing blood vessel growth to ensure sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients. Herein, we have demonstrated that MyD88 expression is required to maintain the angiogenic switch that supports B16 melanoma growth. By knocking down MyD88 we reduced TLR-mediated NF-&#x003ba;B activation with no evident effects over cell proliferation and survival. In addition, MyD88 downregulation was associated with a decrease in the levels of HIF1&#x003b1; and its target gene VEGF, in correlation with an impaired capability to induce capillary sprouting and tube formation of endothelial cells.</p><p>Some recent works have uncovered cell-autonomous functions of MyD88 relevant to oncogenesis and tumor progression. For instance, the TLR2/MyD88 axis has been recognized as a critical regulator of self-renewal of mammary and intestine epithelium as well as breast and colon cancer tumorigenesis [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Also, it was reported that repressing MyD88 in colon cancer cells leads to accumulation of DNA damage resulting in apoptosis dependent on p53 [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, MyD88 could maintain the activation of PI3K/AKT and Ras/ERK pathways, thus contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cellular transformation, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Interestingly, MyD88 mutations caused constitutive activation of NF-kB and STAT3, cooperating to the pathogenesis of B cell malignancies [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our data imply that MyD88 acts intrinsically to promote a protumorigenic tissue microenvironment. Engagement of MyD88 in activated murine melanoma cells triggers an angiogenic program that rely on the secretion of trophic factors for vascular cells, including VEGF, FGF-2, and CXCL15. The actions of MyD88 in regulating the expression of these factors is likely to involve both direct and indirect mechanisms, mainly coordinating the interplay between NF-&#x003ba;B, HIF1&#x003b1;, and STAT3 transcription factors, which are well known for its roles in tumor development and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Early studies have focused on the functions of MyD88 in immune cells, more specifically, on phagocytic and antigen-presenting cells. MyD88 signaling endows these cells with the paradoxical ability to exert both tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting effects, capable of either eliciting a productive antitumor adaptive immunity or promoting a tumor-enhancing immunosuppressive response [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Here, we revealed that melanomas developed from cells lacking MyD88 have an improved infiltration of macrophages to the tumor site. This can be a consequence of the enhanced secretion of chemoattracting ligands involved in the recruitment of this cell linage by shMyD88 cells, including CCL2, CXCL10, and CXCL1 [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It has been previously reported that B16 melanomas are infiltrated with tumor associated macrophages skewed towards an alternative M2-polarized phenotype, which can promote angiogenesis and tissue remodeling, thereby supporting tumor progression and metastatic spread [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This effect, together with a shrinkage in the number of Gr1+ CD11b+ cells (that could be considered immature myeloid cells), might represent a compensatory response to hypoxic avascular tumors. Nonetheless, it has been established that an important mechanism involved in the inherent tumor refractoriness to angiogenic blockade by anti-VEGF therapy is the production of additional proangiogenic molecules besides VEGF by infiltrating myeloid cells, or the recruitment of proangiogenic bone marrow-derived cells [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Modulators of the TLR/MyD88 pathway are currently under investigation in clinical trials for cancer treatment. The use of TLR agonists in antineoplastic therapy is based on its ability to activate antigen-presenting cells which in turn, can orchestrate a tumor-specific immune response. TLR ligands are being tested as vaccine adjuvants together with tumor antigens or used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs or radiotherapy to synergistically enhance their immunostimulatory capacity [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, there is a potential for TLR signaling to occur on either the tumor vasculature or tumor cells themselves that could negate antitumor responses or, as we evidenced in our model, promote tumor growth. Moreover, persistent activation of signals triggered by DAMPs released by dying cells may promote carcinogenesis in a TLR-dependent manner [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A paradigmatic case could be HMGB1, a nuclear non-histone architectural protein involved in DNA binding that can be released after cellular stress and drive TLR4-dependent inflammatory responses [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The presence of cells with cytoplasmic HMGB1 was appreciated by immunofluorescence in sections from B16 tumors and this localization occurs in the context of active HMGB1 release which usually precedes necrosis [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, released HMGB1 could activate the MyD88 pathway in tumor cells and mediate amplification of angiogenesis which can be complementary to the direct effect of HMGB1 on endothelial cells to enhance the expression of proteins involved in proangiogenic cascades, thus contributing to tumor vascularization [<xref rid="pone.0179897.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Consequently, targeting TLR4/MyD88 signaling may be an attractive therapeutic strategy to hinder tumor progression. Though, the final outcome will depend on the TLR expression profile, the specific cellular context, and the balance between the effects of concurrent inhibition of the pathway on malignant cells and innate immune cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our current study defines that downregulation of MyD88 in murine melanoma B16 cells suppresses its angiogenic potential, culminating in significantly impaired subcutaneous tumor growth, associated with a dysregulation of the expression of genes involved in inflammation and angiogenesis. Although extensive work, including especially the investigation of precise MyD88 functions in human melanoma cells, will be needed to elucidate the complete mechanism involved, our results suggest that inhibitors of the MyD88 pathway merit investigation as possible therapeutic and chemoprevention agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Mice and tumor xenografts</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Universidad Nacional de La Plata (Buenos Aires, Argentina).

Infections of B16 cells were performed with virus-containing supernatant supplemented with 6 &#x003bc;g/mL polybrene (Sigma). Stable cell lines were selected with 2 &#x003bc;g/ml of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Quantitative real time RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies), and reverse-transcribed using random primers (Promega) and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). Specific transcripts were quantified by real time qRT-PCR (StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System, Applied Biosystems) using the StepOne Software v2.2.2. Experiments were performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences are indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179897.s002">S1 Table</xref>. The cycling conditions included a hot start at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. Specificity was verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. Fold change in gene expression was calculated according to the 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;Ct</sup> method. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. No amplification was observed in PCR reactions containing water or RNA samples incubated without reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis as template.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>In Cell Western assays</title><p>Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 3&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraforma1dehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized in 0.01% Triton X-100. Blocking was carried out with Odyssey blocking buffer (LICOR Bioscience). Each well was incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with corresponding target primary rabbit antibody (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179897.s003">S2 Table</xref>) and mouse anti-&#x003b1;-tubulin as control, followed by IRDye conjugated anti-rabbit (800 nm) and anti-mouse (700 nm) secondary antibodies incubation at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. A row of cells was included on every plate for incubation with secondary antibodies alone to determine any background level of labelling. Plates were imaged on an Odyssey Infrared Scanner (LI-COR Biosciences) and data analyzed using Image Studio 3.1 software.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Cell proliferation and viability</title><p>Proliferation rate and cell survival were evaluated with the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega). In brief, for cell proliferation, B16 cells were plated in triplicate wells of a 96-well plate at a density of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> cells/well and further treated as indicated. In the case of viability assays, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well were seeded and incubated with media containing dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle, Sigma-Aldrich), doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich), or cis-diammineplatinum (II) (Sigma-Aldrich). After 48 h, cell densities were measured following incubation for 2 h with a combined MTS/PMS solution and absorbance was measured at 490 nm on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Cellular growth was calculated from the absorbance ratio between values obtained at the end point with respect to those measured in cells before treatment. All assays were independently performed three times.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>Exponentially growing B16 cell lines were treated with vehicle or LPS as indicated.

As controls, cells were transfected with a CMV promoter-driven luciferase vector (pCMV-Luc). Luciferase and Renilla activities were measured on a GloMax-Multi Detection System (Promega) using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized by the values of the Renilla luciferase and expressed as relative light units.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Antibody array</title><p>For the cytokine array, 1&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells were plated onto 100 mm plates in tissue culture media and grown to 90% confluence. Media was replaced with 5 ml of fresh DMEM supplemented with 1% serum 24 h prior the experiment. Culture supernatants were harvested and diluted according to the final cell number. The expression of angiogenesis-related proteins was detected using the Proteome Profiler Mouse Angiogenesis Array Kit (ARY015; R&#x00026;D Systems) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocols. Developed films were scanned and analyzed by quantifying the mean spot pixel densities using the NIH ImageJ software. Averaged background signal was subtracted and corresponding signals on different arrays were normalized using internal controls.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>In vitro capillary tube formation assays</title><p>HMEC-1 were seeded on growth factor-reduced matrigel-coated plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> cells/well.

Briefly, mice were euthanized and whole tumors surgically resected, minced into smaller sections, and mechanically dissociated. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by enzymatic digestion and submitted to Ficoll-Hypaque (GE Healthcare) gradient centrifugation. Cells were subsequently washed with PBS containing 0.1% serum and stained with antibodies to detect endothelial and immune cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179897.s003">S2 Table</xref>) diluted in FACS buffer (EDTA 5 mmol/L, sodium azide 0.1%, BSA 1% in PBS). Analysis was conducted in a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo software (Tree Star). To evaluate the number of cells expressing the endothelial markers CD31 and Tie2, tumors were dissociated as described below and then a fixed number of cells were acquired in a storage gate that was exactly the same for all the samples analyzed. Results are expressed as % of total events.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Tumors for immunofluorescence staining were obtained after overnight fixation with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde. Then, they were dehydrated with 30% sucrose in PBS for 72 h, embedded in OCT compound, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Frozen tumors were sectioned into 14-mm-thick sections with a Leica cryostat. Slices were permeabilized in 0.01% Triton X-100, blocked in 0.4% fish skin gelatin and 0.2% Tween-20, and incubated with anti-HMGB1 in PBS-2.5% goat serum. Secondary staining proceeded with the anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody in PBS-2.5% goat serum. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.
