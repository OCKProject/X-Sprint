During metastatic spread of the disease an imbalance in the oxidative stress and inflammation plays a crucial role in tumor progression. In order to improve the efficacy of current therapies, new complementary therapeutic approaches are being analyzed including biologically active compounds with low side effects. The anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties of Ocoxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> oral solution (OOS) prompt us to analyze its effect on the metastatic development of CRC to the liver. First, <italic>in vitro</italic> effect of OOS in tumor cell viability and migration was analyzed. Second, <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of different dosage patterns and concentrations in the development of hepatic metastasis was analyzed by intrasplenic inoculation of C26 colon carcinoma cells in Balb/c mice. Third, the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin, caspase-3 and Ki-67 expression was quantified by immunohistochemistry, then gene expression levels of inflammatory factors were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. According to our results, OOS reduced tumor cell viability and migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, <italic>in vivo</italic> daily administration of OOS from the 7th day after tumor cell inoculation decreased the total area and size of metastatic foci in the liver. Furthermore, cell proliferation and fibroblast recruitment was decreased in tumor foci while a higher number of apoptotic cells were observed. Finally, RNA levels for the inflammatory mediators COX-2, IFN&#x003b3;, IL1&#x003b2;, IL6 and TNF&#x003b1; were reduced in total liver. In conclusion, OOS reduced the metastatic development of colorectal cancer to the liver by increasing apoptosis, and decreasing tumor cell proliferation and fibroblast recruitment in the tumor foci, as well as the expression of inflammatory mediators in total liver. These results point out OOS as a potential supplement to be applied as complementary therapy for the treatment of liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>ocoxin oral solution</kwd><kwd>nutrient mixture</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most aggressive cancers in the western countries. Despite the development of new treatments, patients suffering from this disease die of the spread of the primary cancer to other organs, mainly the liver, rather than from the primary tumor. To date, the only effective treatment is hepatic resection, and thus, a novel and effective therapies are urgently needed to treat metastatic disease, improving life expectancy and quality in CRC patients. Several studies have included biologically active compounds due to their low toxicity and excellent potential for cancer treatment.</p><p>The relationship between inflammation and tumor development is widely accepted (<xref rid="b1-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). During the progression of cancer inflammatory cells are recruited into the tumor stroma by signals derived from the tumor, as well as from the cells residing in the organ that is being colonized. This inflammatory milieu results in the trigger for oxidative stress. In this scenery, the presence of oxidative and inflammatory factors play a crucial role regulating the expression of genes involved in tumor progression and metastasis (<xref rid="b2-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>This off balance in the microenvironment of the developing tumor affects the major cell types of the host organ in the tumor, namely, the cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (<xref rid="b3-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The CAFs contribute to this pro-tumoral microenvironment by further producing pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors favoring the growth of the tumor, invasion of the targeted organ, angiogenesis and finally metastasis (<xref rid="b3-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>This inflammatory and oxidative millieu has encouraged the validation of several nutritional and biological components with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, as complements for antitumor therapies. Among others, extracts from green tea and licorice, and vitamins has been reported to possess immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties which make them excellent candidates for the validation of their anti-tumorigenic and anti-metastatic effects in different types of cancer (<xref rid="b4-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Moreover, the administration of several of these compounds as nutrient mixtures has shown greater efficacy than their administration as individual treatments (<xref rid="b8-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>OOS is a nutritional supplement with recognized anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The solution is composed, among others, of green tea extract, glyzyrrhicic acid, vitamin C, B6 and B12, minerals and aminoacids. It was synthesized by combining two products, Viusid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and Ocoxin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The Viusid component has been tested in different clinical trials showing beneficial effects in patients suffering from chronic hepatitis C and cirrhosis (<xref rid="b10-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Moreover, OOS antitumor effects have validated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> preclinical breast cancer models (<xref rid="b12-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Thus, we aim to study the effects of OOS in the metastatic progression of CRC to the liver.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate the inhibitory effect OOS <italic>in vitro</italic> and an <italic>in vivo</italic> pre-clinical model of metastatic development of colorectal carcinoma to the liver. We show that OOS exerts its effect by reducing tumor cell proliferation and by increasing apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, this nutritional supplement shows not only a reduction in the fibroblast recruitment to the tumor stroma, which has been related to angiogenesis and tumor progression (<xref rid="b13-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), but also to a modulation of the inflammatory signature in the liver. Thus, OOS might be a novel and effective complementary treatment which properties might help to increase the efficacy of actual anti-metastatic therapies as well as to improve the life-quality of patients suffering from this disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Balb/c mice (male, 8-weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories Espa&#x000f1;a S.A.

Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of OOS, a complex mixture containing licorice extract, vitamins and minerals which have proven anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in other diseases (<xref rid="b15-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) in the metastatic development of colon carcinoma cells. Here, we highlight the anti-metastatic effect of this nutrient mixture <italic>in vivo</italic> by means of reducing tumor cell proliferation, migration and recruitment of CAFs, along with an increase in apoptosis. Additionally, the mixture induced a decrease in the expression of RNA levels for pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors in metastasized liver provoking a slow down of the metastatic development of colorectal cancer C26 cells to the liver. Thus, these results support the need for further studies for the use of OOS as a nutritional complement during the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastatic disease.</p><p>According to our results, the effect of OOS on the metastatic progression of C26 cells to the liver depends on the dosage pattern. Because a significant reduction in the tumor burden of the liver was observed only in the mice treated with OOS 7 days after tumor cell inoculation, but not when the solution was administered days before the tumor inoculation. Lode <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b17-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) have reported the inefficacy of a nutrient mixture against metastasis in a neuroblastoma model. However, as stated by Niedzwiecki (<xref rid="b18-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) these observations might be due to several reasons. On the one hand, the excessive amount of cells inoculated by the authors or the need for longer and continuous periods of treatment may account for this lack of effect. On the other hand, antioxidants have been proved to exert their functions mainly in the presence of chronic inflammation and in a highly hypoxic environment (<xref rid="b1-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In the absence of a highly inflammatory and pro-oxidant microenvironment biologically active compounds might lack their anti-tumoral activity (<xref rid="b19-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), such as the one in mice before the tumor inoculation. Thus, this could explain the lack of effect of OOS in the early stage treatment. Even so, further studies are needed to fully establish the mechanisms of OOS when it is administered at early stages.</p><p>Dietary agents are believed to suppress, among others, the hyper-proliferative processes during the development of a tumor. Several phytochemicals have been shown to exert suppressive effects on AP-1 and NF-&#x003ba;B interfering with growth and proliferative signals (<xref rid="b20-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In accordance to this, supplementation with dietary nutrient mixture OOS significantly slows down murine colon carcinoma C26 tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> in immune competent mice related to a decrease in the intratumoral expression of Ki-67, an antigen strictly associated with cell proliferation. The <italic>in vitro</italic> studies supported these findings since the viability of tumor cells was significantly decreased and a slight reduction in the number of cells in phase S was induced by OOS treatment. Along with these results, an increase in the amount of cells in phase G<sub>2</sub>/M was observed. In fact, cathechins and licorice components cause cell cycle arrest by downregulating cyclin D1 and E, key molecules in G<sub>1</sub> to S transition and completion of the latter one (<xref rid="b22-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Ultimately, the cell cycle arrest will trigger cell cycle deregulation and apoptotic processes via upregulation of p21 and p27, both well-known tumor suppressor proteins downregulated in numerous cancers (<xref rid="b24-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In addition to the effect in the cell cycle progression, OOS breaks the characteristic resistance of tumor cells to enter apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, an increase in cell number in subG1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and the intratumoral increase of caspase-3 <italic>in vivo</italic> after treatment with the complex nutrient mixture points to the induction of programmed cell death within tumor foci by this compound. The hypoxic and inflammatory tumor microenvironment induces the activation of anti-apoptotic pathways supporting the effect of anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidative drugs which have been shown to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to pro-apoptotic signals (<xref rid="b25-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In addition to its effects in tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis, OOS reduced the migratory potential of C26 colon carcinoma cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Migration of tumor cells is a key step not only for invasion of adjacent tissue in the primary organ but also for extravasation and colonization of the secondary target organ during the metastasic process. It is well-known that chronic inflammation is linked to oxidative stress and both of them are related to the invasive and migratory potential of cancer cells during tumor progression (<xref rid="b1-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Thus, the migratory capacity of tumor cells is also a potential target for nutrient mixtures with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. Roomi <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b9-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b14-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) have shown that <italic>in vitro</italic>, a nutrient mixture consisting in lysine, ascorbic acid, proline and green tea, among others, significantly reduced the migratory potential of a selected set of different tumor cell types related to a decrease in the levels of pro-migratory and pro-angiogenic factors such as proteases and VEGF (<xref rid="b9-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b14-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>In the hepatic tumor microenvironment, myofibroblasts are the most prominent CAFs. In the liver, CAFs are mainly originated from transdifferentiated hepatic stellate cells in the tumor stroma, and such tumor activated-hepatic stellate cells promote tumor growth and invasiveness (<xref rid="b26-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Additionally, they contribute not only to create a pro-tumoral stroma but also to trigger the angiogenic switch allowing one step forward from an avascular to a vascular state during the metastasic tumor growth (<xref rid="b26-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Furthermore, these tumor associated fibroblasts participate actively in the production of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant factors taking active part in tumor expansion by inducing, among others, the trigering of an angiogenic response. Moreover, recruited fibroblasts within a tumor have been positively correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (<xref rid="b27-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In our model, the nutrient mixture OOS reduced the recruitment of myofibroblasts within the tumor foci, as shown by a decreased amount of ASMA expressing cells within the tumor foci which might also account for the reduced angiogenesis. This reduction in myofibroblast infiltration <italic>in vivo</italic> was related with an impaired migratory potential of 3T3 fibroblast <italic>in vitro</italic> by OOS (data not shown). The impaired recruitment of CAFs might account as an additional mechanism by which the nutrient mixture might exert its antitumoral effects. Indeed, several compounds with anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties reduce the angiogenic response in different types of tumors and show a significant impact in the tumor stroma formation (<xref rid="b28-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>The antioxidant properties of several components of OOS, such as polyphenols, cannot fully explain their antitumoral activity. Cathechins modulate inflammatory pathways since they act as signaling agents by interfering with NF-&#x003ba;B and AP-1 which, in turn, results in inhibition of pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors, including IL6, IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1; and VEGF (<xref rid="b29-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Among them, TNF&#x003b1; or IL-1&#x003b2; induce the expression of growth factors, stimulate epithelial tumor motility and tumor angiogenesis (<xref rid="b30-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Another proinflammatory molecule commonly upregulated in colon cancer, COX-2, has been implicated in the growth and progression of colorectal cancer via multiple pathways (<xref rid="b32-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>) including the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis and promoting angiogenesis through VEGF production (<xref rid="b35-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Moreover, a decrease in COX-2 expression at RNA levels in total liver caused by OOS administration might be related to a reduction in VEGF levels (<xref rid="b36-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Additionally, the reduction in Il-1&#x003b2;, and TNF&#x003b1; RNA levels after OOS administration is consistent with the downregulation in the levels of COX-2 RNA which is commonly stimulated by cytokines such as Il-1&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; as a result of the interaction between colon carcinoma cells and the cells of the liver microenvironment (<xref rid="b36-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37-or-35-03-1265" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>In summary, OOS slows down the metastatic progression of CRC to the liver. Thus, the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of this nutrient mixture induced an inhibition of the proliferative and migratory potential of tumor cells which together with an increase in the sensitivity to apoptotic signals might modulate the metastatic development of colorectal cancer cells to the liver. Besides, OOS limits tumor infiltration by CAFs and inhibits the production of inflammatory and angiogenic factors within the tumor microenvironment. Collectively, this creates an unfavorable and non-permissive microenvironment for tumor growth suppressing the final steps of tumor progression. Therefore, OOS may constitute a pharmacologically safe complementary compound for the treatment of cancer and its metastasis slowing down the tumor growth, and, thus, increasing the life time and quality for patients suffering from CRC liver metastasis. The above justifies further characterization and validation of OOS in the metastatic development and their combination with actual therapies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Evangelina Garcia and Maria Jesus Fernandez for the excellent technical assistance.
