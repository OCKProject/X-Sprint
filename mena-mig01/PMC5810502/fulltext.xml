Plectin knockdown promotes cell migration by activating focal adhesion kinase and Rac1-GTPase activity in liver cells. Sorafenib is a multi-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor that improves patient survival on hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between the expression of plectin and cell migration as well as the sensitivity of hepatoma cell lines exposing to sorafenib. Hepatoma cell lines PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 were used to examine the level of plectin expression and cell migration in comparison with Chang liver cell line. In addition, sensitivity of the 3 cell lines to sorafenib treatment was also measured. Expression of plectin was lower in PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 hepatoma cells than that of Chang liver cells whereas HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells exhibit higher rate of cell migration in trans-well migration assay. Immunohistofluorecent staining on E-cadherin revealed the highest rate of collective cell migration in HepG2 cells and the lowest was found in Chang liver cells. Likewise, HepG2 cell line was most sensitive to sorafenib treatment and Chang liver cells exhibited the least sensitivity. The drug sensitivity to sorafenib treatment showed inverse correlation with the expression of plectin. We suggest that plectin deficiency and increased E-cadherin in hepatoma cells were associated with higher rates of cell motility, collective cell migration as well as higher drug sensitivity to sorafenib treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>E-cadherin</kwd><kwd>hepatocellular carcinoma</kwd><kwd>plectin</kwd><kwd>sorafenib</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital</named-content></funding-source><award-id>RD104005</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital</named-content></funding-source><award-id>RD105050</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital</named-content></funding-source><award-id>RD105051</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital under grants RD104005, RD105050 and RD105051.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="30"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs), intermediate filaments (IFs), and microfilaments (MFs) are major components of the cytoskeleton that are essential to maintain the integrity of eukaryotic cells.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Proper cross-linking structures among these cytoskeletal proteins are crucial for intracellular architectures and normal cellular morphology.

In contrast, collective cell migration was significantly increased in hepatoma cells compared with hepatic cells. For adjacent epithelial cells, E-cadherin molecules render strong mechanical attachment between adherent junctions.

Likewise, higher rate of collective cell migration was found in hepatoma cells rather than hepatic cells. Based on these findings, we suggest that the higher degree of collective cell migration in hepatoma cells is associated with the increased expression of E-cadherin and decrease in plectin.

In addition, plectin knockdown in hepatic cells were also more sensitive to sorafenib treatment than mock hepatic cells. In accordance, we hypothesize that individual levels of plectin and E-cadherin in patients with HCC may be correlated with their sensitivity to sorafenib exposure. The future study will be planned to develop cell lines expressing different levels of plectin by molecular manipulation and to examine their sensitivity to sorafenib treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, higher cell motility and collecting migration are associated with deficiency in plectin and increased expression of E-cadherin in hepatoma cells. Plectin may be involved in the regulation of cell motility that is related to the invasiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma. We also suggest that hepatoma cells with plectin deficiency and high level of E-cadherin are more sensitive to sorafenib treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0004"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Materials</title><p>Goat anti-plectin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
