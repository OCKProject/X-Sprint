    "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been under continuous populational influences from Asia, Europe, and Africa, making it an ideal site for epidemiological studies on Helicobacter pylori. However, there has been a paucity of well-designed prevalence studies on H. pylori from UAE. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of H. pylori and its associated risk factors in the UAE. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted on healthy asymptomatic residents of UAE. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, and gastrointestinal characteristics of participants were obtained through a questionnaire in parallel within the stool sample collection. A total of 350 participants were included in this study and were tested for H. pylori using the stool antigen test (Premier Platinum HpSAT). Out of the total tested study participants, 41% were found to be H. pylori-infected. Logistic regression analysis has shown a significant association between H. pylori infection and gender, age, ethnicity, profession, domestic overcrowding, source of drinking water, and gastrointestinal characteristics of participants. Based on the results from this study, we suggest that preventive measures against H. pylori infection should be considered worthy by public health authorities."
