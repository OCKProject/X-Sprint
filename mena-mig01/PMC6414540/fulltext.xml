In human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, the primary site for the fusion of optic fissure margins, FAT1 is localized at earliest cell-cell junctions, consistent with a role in facilitating optic fissure fusion during vertebrate eye development.

This invagination is asymmetric, and a ventral opening (optic fissure) forms around the 5th week of human gestation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. For the eye to develop normally, the two edges of the fissure must approximate and fuse. If the optic fissure fails to fuse, uveal coloboma, a potentially blinding congenital malformation, results. Uveal coloboma accounts for up to 10% of childhood blindness worldwide, affecting between 0.5 and 2.6 per 10,000 births<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Mutations in several developmentally regulated genes, including <italic>CHD7</italic>, <italic>CHX10/VSX2</italic>, <italic>GDF3</italic>, <italic>GDF6</italic>, <italic>MAF</italic>, <italic>OTX2</italic>, <italic>PAX2</italic>, <italic>PAX6</italic>, <italic>RAX</italic>, <italic>SHH</italic>, <italic>SIX3</italic>, <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>FOXE3, STRA6, BCOR</italic>, <italic>BMP4, YAP1</italic>, and <italic>MITF</italic>, have been reported in patients with uveal coloboma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To our knowledge the <italic>FAT1</italic> gene has not been previously associated with microphthalmia and coloboma.</p><p id="Par4">The <italic>FAT</italic> cadherins are involved in fundamental developmental processes including cell&#x02013;cell contact<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, planar cell polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and maintenance of apical&#x02013;basal polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> in epithelial cells. Loss of FAT1 function causes decreased epithelial cell adhesion and podocyte foot process effacement, resulting in abnormal glomerular filtration and nephropathy in humans and mouse, and cystic kidney in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>Fat1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also display partially penetrant anterior neural tube closure defects due to reduced actin accumulation, leading to apical constriction defects in the neural epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These developmental observations in epithelial cell types suggest that <italic>FAT1</italic> plays an important role in epithelial cell&#x02013;cell adhesion and/or sheet fusion. Epithelial sheet fusion is one of the most critical morphogenetic events occurring during embryonic development, failure of which causes clinically well-characterized congenital defects including, neural tube closure defects (e.g. spina bifida), secondary palatal epithelial fusion defects (e.g. cleft palate), defective fusion of bilateral urogenital primordia (e.g. hypospadias), and optic fissure closure defects (e.g. coloboma)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We here report five unrelated families exhibiting a syndromic form of coloboma associated with homozygous frame-shift mutations in the <italic>FAT1</italic> gene.

Furthermore, studies conducted in human primary retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells point to a defect in optic fissure margin fusion likely caused by loss of FAT1 at the earliest cell&#x02013;cell contacts that mediate optic fissure fusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>FAT1</italic> mutations cause a syndromic form of colobomatous microphthalmia</title><p id="Par6">We identified homozygous frameshift variants in the atypical protocadherin <italic>FAT1</italic> by whole exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing confirmation in 10 affected individuals from five unrelated consanguineous families of Middle-Eastern, Turkish, Pakistani, and North-African descent (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Patient F3-IV-1 presented with stage 5 chronic kidney disease at the age of 20 and a biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. His brother, patient F3-IV-3, developed intermittent proteinuria with normal kidney function at the age of 20 years. Patient F5-II-1 was hospitalized at the age of 15 years with proteinuria and hematuria and renal biopsy displayed glomerulotubular nephropathy (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

Knockdown of <italic>FAT1</italic> in RPE cells before monolayer formation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) resulted in failure to organize F-ACTIN fibers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), loss of ZO-1 staining from cell&#x02013;cell junctions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), and significantly reduced trans-epithelial barrier potential, suggesting compromised junctional integrity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). As such, FAT1 might play an important role in the earliest RPE cell&#x02013;cell junctions and F-ACTIN filament organization during RPE monolayer formation.

Although we found a strikingly high penetrance of ocular and limb defects in affected individuals, renal dysfunction was less prominent. We found a wide spectrum of renal involvement ranging from asymptomatic proteinuria (3/10) to severe nephrotic syndrome (2/10). In addition, in some of the affected individuals, proteinuria was only present intermittently. We therefore recommend that asymptomatic <italic>FAT1</italic> patients should undergo clinical evaluation of kidney function, which should be repeated on a regular basis. <italic>FAT1</italic> is another example of a gene wherein genetic variation has pleiotropic effects, with biallellic missense variants leading to non-syndromic glomerulotubular nephropathy and homozygous frameshift variants causing the broad multi-system disorder that we describe here.</p><p id="Par17">Our mechanistic studies in mice, zebrafish, and RPE cell cultures support the causality of <italic>FAT1</italic> biallellic frameshift variants in the pathogenesis of coloboma, and for the first time implicate <italic>FAT1</italic> in optic fissure fusion during eye development. During optic fissure closure apposing margins of the presumptive neural retina that are lined by presumptive RPE adhere initially by cellular protrusions (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">6a</xref>), then proceed to form more stable appositional junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and subsequently undergo differentiation of the RPE and neuroepithelium to yield a complete eye where RPE is overlying neural retina. In our previous study we showed that genes that are dynamically expressed at the apposing edges of the optic fissure margins during the process of optic fissure closure are important in this developmental process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

Though we were not able to show FAT1 immunoreactivity at the earliest cellular processes that initiate the optic fissure fusion process, due to technical difficulties, we did observe the presence of Fat1 mRNA at the leading edges of the optic fissure margins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c, e, f</xref>).
