Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Lamellipodin (Lpd) functions as an important signalling integrator downstream of growth factor and axon guidance receptors. Mechanistically, Lpd promotes actin polymerization by interacting with F-actin and the actin effectors Ena/VASP proteins and the SCAR/WAVE complex. Thereby, Lpd supports lamellipodia protrusion, cell migration and endocytosis. In the mammalian central nervous system, Lpd contributes to neuronal morphogenesis, neuronal migration during development and its <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> orthologue MIG-10 also supports synaptogenesis. However, the consequences of loss of Lpd in the CNS on behaviour are unknown. In our current study, we crossed our Lpd conditional knockout mice with a mouse line expressing Cre under the CNS specific Nestin promoter to restrict the genetic ablation of Lpd to the central nervous system. Detailed behavioural analysis of the resulting Nestin-Cre-Lpd knockout mouse line revealed a specific behavioural phenotype characterised by hyperactivity and increased anxiety.</p> </div> <div class="custom-meta-group" title="custom-meta-group"> <meta name="issue-copyright-statement" value="© The Author(s) 2017" /> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <div class="introduction" title="introduction"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p id="Par2">Lamellipodin (Lpd; official HGNC gene symbol: RAPH1) is a vertebrate member of the MRL (MIG-10, RIAM, Lamellipodin) protein family which also includes RIAM in vertebrates, MIG-10 in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> and Pico in <i>Drosophila</i><sup><a href="#CR1">1</a>–<a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. Lpd localises to the very edge of lamellipodia, the tips of filopodia, and to clathrin coated pits<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR6">6</a></sup>. At these locations, Lpd functions as an important signalling integrator downstream of growth factor and axon guidance receptors. It is a direct Ras and Rac effector and also functions downstream of PI3-kinase signalling via its Ras-association and PH domains<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR7">7</a>–<a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. Mechanistically, Lpd recruits Ena/VASP proteins and interacts with endophilin, the SCAR/WAVE complex and F-actin via its proline-rich C-terminal region to promote actin polymerization. Thereby, Lpd supports axonal morphogenesis, endocytosis, lamellipodia protrusion, cell migration and metastasis<sup><a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR7">7</a>, <a href="#CR9">9</a>–<a href="#CR13">13</a></sup>. The Scar/WAVE complex regulates actin nucleation through the Arp2/3 complex and Ena/VASP proteins promote actin filament elongation<sup><a href="#CR14">14</a>, <a href="#CR15">15</a></sup>. Consistently, its orthologue in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>, MIG-10, functions as a regulator of axon guidance, synaptic vesicle clustering during synaptogenesis and neuronal migration in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i><sup><a href="#CR4">4</a>, <a href="#CR16">16</a>–<a href="#CR18">18</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par3">Several lines of evidence indicate that Lpd plays a role in the development of the mammalian CNS. Lpd is expressed uniformly throughout the cortex during embryonic development<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a></sup>. Stimulation of primary cortical neurons with the axon guidance cue netrin-1 results in Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Lpd. Depletion of Lpd impairs axonal elongation and branching of primary hippocampal neurons. Consistently, Lpd and c-Abl co-overexpression promotes hippocampal axonal morphogenesis in an Ena/VASP protein dependent manner<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. Moreover, Lpd is required for the M-Ras mediated outgrowth and branching of cortical dendrites, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i><sup><a href="#CR20">20</a></sup>. Depletion of Lpd in pyramidal neurons arising from the ventricular zone during corticogenesis in the mouse embryo elicited an aberrant cortical phenotype, with the cortical neurons switching from a radial to a tangential pattern of migration that leads to their accumulation within the subventricular and intermediate zones<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a></sup>. Lpd knockdown also reduced the number of primary processes in multipolar neurons accumulating in the multipolar cell accumulation zone before they initiate their radial migration in the developing cortex<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par4">In summary, the available evidence suggests that Lpd promotes neuronal morphogenesis, neuronal migration during CNS development in mice and synaptogenesis in <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i>. Therefore, we set out to evaluate the consequences of loss of Lpd in the CNS on the behaviour of mice by testing them through a comprehensive behavioural screen. We previously had generated conditional knockout mice for Lpd, which we crossed to PGK-Cre general deleter mice on a pure C57BL6 background. Most of these mice died just after birth with the few surviving mice displaying a ventral pigmentation defect. Crossing the Lpd conditional mice to general deleter beta-Actin-Cre mice on a mixed genetic background allowed more offspring to survive. The surviving mice displayed a ventral pigmentation defect which was due to a melanoblast migration/proliferation defect<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. In our current study, we crossed our Lpd conditional mice with a mouse line expressing Cre under the CNS specific Nestin promoter to restrict the genetic ablation to the central nervous system. Our results revealed a specific behavioural phenotype resulting from the genetic ablation characterized by hyperactivity and increased anxiety in the open field test.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Generation of CNS-specific knockout mice for Lpd</div> <p id="Par5">Conditional Lpd knockout mice<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup> were crossed with another line in which Cre was constitutively expressed under the regulation of the nestin promoter to generate Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice. From crosses of Lpd flox/flox males with Lpd flox/flox; Nestin-Cre/- females we obtained the expected Mendelian ratio of cre-expressing knockout mice at P10 (47.7% based on 15 individual litters, Z-score = 0.24), indicating that the genetic ablation did not affect viability. In brains of Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice we observed loss of Lpd expression and no change in expression levels of the actin effector proteins, Mena, VASP, Scar/WAVE1, and Scar/WAVE2, all of which normally interact with Lpd, when compared to Lpd flox/flox control brains (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a–e</a>). The knockout mice exhibited a normal lifespan and no morphological defects were evident. Statistical analysis of adult weight values yielded the expected significant difference between male and female mice (27.90 ± 0.53 grams, SEM, n = 21 vs. 24.11 ± 0.30 grams, SEM, n = 18, F[1,35] = 33.46, p &amp;lt; 0.0001), but no significant effect of genotype (F[1,35] = 0.12, p = 0.7357) and no interaction between the two factors (F[1,35] = 0.46, p = 0.5007, Two-way ANOVA) were observed. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <p>Expression levels of Lpd and associated actin regulators in Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice.

Discussion</div> <p id="Par20">Our results show that brain specific conditional Lpd knockout mice exhibit an abnormal behavioural pattern of hyperactivity and anxiety that is consistently evident across a number of different behavioural tests.</p> <p id="Par21">SHIRPA designates a standardized battery of behavioural tests designed to provide a quick and sensitive assessment of a wide number of behavioural parameters<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a></sup>. The performance of Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice during the test suggests that sensory abilities and basic reflexes appear to be intact. However, a subset of the quantified variables showed significant differences according to the genotype of the individual. The levels of spontaneous activity displayed when they were under observation in the viewing jar were unusually high in Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice. Furthermore, the tendency of the Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice to explore when transferred to a novel arena, both in terms of locomotion across the novel environment and the frequency of rearing behaviour, was also elevated when compared to their wild type littermates. Taken together, these results are suggestive of a hyperactive phenotype in the knockout animals manifested in both sexes, while at the same time they rule out the presence of basic sensory or neurological impairments derived from the absence of Lpd.</p> <p id="Par22">The light/dark box test is normally used for the assessment of anxiety levels, and time spent in the lit half of the arena is considered to be the most reliable parameter to estimate them. In the present study, there were no significant differences for this variable between knockout and wild type mice. However, Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice showed enhanced levels of exploration while in the darkened chamber, expressed as a significantly longer distance covered. This is consistent with the increased exploratory behaviour displayed during the SHIRPA test.</p> <p id="Par23">In the open field test the time the male Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice spent exploring the inner zone was significantly lower than that of their male wild type littermates. Since animals that spend less time in the inner zone of the open field arena are normally considered to be more anxious compared to those that prefer the perimeter adjacent to the walls<sup><a href="#CR23">23</a></sup>, these results suggest the existence of higher levels of anxiety in male Lpd KO animals. Independent of sex, we observed for all Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice that latency to enter this area in the first place was noticeably longer, further suggesting increased anxiety. However, this contradicts the results from the light/dark box test, which suggested that anxiety levels were no different than in wild type animals. Since the outcome of the open field test is known to show important variations according to the particular experimental conditions<sup><a href="#CR24">24</a></sup>, it is possible that our chosen conditions were stringent enough to uncover a slight increase in anxiety levels in the male Lpd KO mice that is not evident when probed by the smaller, less anxiety-generating light/dark box. The open field test likely reflects both anxiety levels versus exploratory behaviour of the mouse, given exploration of this arena represent a conflict between the drive to explore versus avoidance of a potentially threatening area<sup><a href="#CR25">25</a></sup>. It is interesting to note that, in agreement with what was observed in previous tests, Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice also showed signs of hyperactivity in the open field. Their speed within the inner zone was significantly higher than that of their wild type littermates and the latency to show rearing behaviour in the inner zone was significantly lower. In addition, there were clear trends that almost reached significance for a lower latency to show rearing behaviour in the outer zone and the frequency of jumping behaviour during the test.</p> <p id="Par24">There were also differences when the mice were confronted with a novel object, but interestingly they were highly dependent on the sex of the individual. Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO females spent more time than wild type females investigating the novel object but there were no differences between the males. Independent of sex, we observed during this novel object exploration test that all Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice also spent less time climbing the cage bars. Since bar climbing was in this context a proxy of cage exploration as opposed to novel object exploration, this suggests reduced exploration of cage environment by Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice.</p> <p id="Par25">The abnormal phenotype of the Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice was for some specific variables only evident in one of the sexes. This is not entirely surprising, since important sex differences in behavioural tests in rodents have been identified for decades, and this is especially true for those tests aimed at measuring anxiety levels<sup><a href="#CR26">26</a></sup>. It may be the case that specific characteristics of the CNS in one of the sexes obscures the effect of the absence of Lpd, and therefore this absence may become evident in the behavioural phenotype of individuals of the opposite sex only. Our results highlight the importance of including experimental subjects of both sexes in any attempt to characterize the behavioural phenotype of any given mouse model in order to minimize the risk of missing some potentially meaningful differences because of this fact<sup><a href="#CR27">27</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par26">Both wild type and Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice showed the expected improvement in their ability to stay on top of the rotating cylinder during successive trial sessions in the rotarod (motor learning), as evidenced by the good fit of the data to a linear curve with slopes that were significantly different from zero but no different from each other. However, the difference in the X intercept values between the two curves indicates that during any single trial during the testing protocol the Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice took longer to fall off the apparatus and therefore exhibited a better motor coordination compared to wild type littermates. This in turn suggests that the absence of Lpd during CNS development does not impair motor learning per se, but it does seem to have an improving effect of the basal levels of the type of motor coordination that the animal is capable of displaying in the rotarod, and this difference is consistently maintained throughout training. This outcome is also in agreement with the enhanced mobility and speed that KO animals showed in the other tests in this study.</p> <p id="Par27">Remarkably, we failed to find any difference between the genotypes for the variables quantified during home cage monitoring. We conclude that the signs of hyperactivity and enhanced exploratory behaviour that were evident in the other test must require the mouse to be introduced into a novel environment (the testing apparatus) in order to become evident. In the home cage, where anxiety levels and tendency to explore can be expected to be at minimum due to prolonged habituation, KO individuals appear to adopt a behavioural pattern that is indistinguishable from that of their wild type littermates.</p> <p id="Par28">Taken together, our behavioural analysis of CNS specific Lpd knockout mice revealed hyperactivity and increased anxiety. On the cellular level these phenotypes may be due to Lpd’s known role in axonal and dendritic extension/branching and neuronal migration, which may cause altered neuronal connectivity during development. Since Lpd’s <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> orthologue MIG-10 supports synaptic vesicle clustering<sup><a href="#CR18">18</a></sup> and Lpd promotes endocytosis<sup><a href="#CR6">6</a></sup> and localises to synapses (M. Krause, unpublished observation), loss of Lpd may affect synapse function and/or dendritic spine formation and dynamics and we are exploring these various possibilities. To our knowledge, this set of results represent the first piece of evidence suggesting that the previously characterized role of Lpd in the regulation of neuronal morphogenesis and migration has a behavioural correlate in mammals. Further studies will elucidate the specific subsystems within the CNS affected by the absence of Lpd that are responsible for the observed phenotype.</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Conditional knockout Lpd mice</div> <p id="Par32">The generation of the C57BL/6 conditional Lpd (RAPH1) knockout mice has been described previously<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup> and these mice were crossed with C57BL/6 mice heterozygous for Nestin-Cre (kindly provided by Axel Behrens, CRICK, London, UK) to generate Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice on a C57BL/6 genetic background. Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO (Lpd flox/flox; Nestin-Cre/-) mice (heterozygous for Nestin-Cre) and their wild type (Lpd flox/flox) littermates of both sexes were used as experimental subjects. Mice were housed in standard cages measuring 32 × 16 × 14 cm with sawdust (Litaspen premium, Datesand Ltd, Manchester), a cardboard shelter and additional bedding material (Sizzlenest, Datesand Ltd, Manchester) with ad libitum access to water and food (Rat and Mouse 3 Diet, Special Diet Services, Essex, UK). The housing and test rooms were maintained at constant room temperature (21 °C) and humidity (45%) and kept under a regular light/dark schedule with lights on from 07:30 to 19:30 hours (light = 270 lux). All animals were tested when they were between three and six months of age, and were individually housed one week before the start of the testing protocol. Animals were singly housed when adult to avoid any potential confounds from social hierarchies and aggressive behaviour hierarchies, which could influence the controlled assessment of social behaviours<sup><a href="#CR29">29</a></sup>. The oestrous phase of the female mice was not checked in this study. However, it is unlikely that this affected results because there were no major effects in the variance between males and females. Sawdust was changed every other week but never on the day before or the day of testing and the enrichment (nesting material and house) was changed less regularly to minimize the disruption to the animals. Numbers (n = 8–12/genotype/sex) were based on typical sample sizes used in behavioural testing. To detect differences in behaviour, sample sizes of 8–12 animals of each sex per group should be sufficient to obtain statistical significance, based on power analysis using a significance level of p &amp;lt; 0.05 with a 2-sided test, a power of 90%, and moderate effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.4). The effect size was calculated from our published data on the C57BL/6 J background strain<sup><a href="#CR30">30</a></sup> and the recommendation of the Mouse Phenome Project (<a href="http://phenome.jax.org/">http://phenome.jax.org/</a>). The same cohort of mice was used for all tests. All experiments, with the exception of the home cage monitoring, were performed during the daytime light on phase (2 PM−5 PM) of the regular light/dark schedule. The control or Nestin-Cre-Lpd KO mice were tested in a random order. The sequence of the tests was: SHIRPA, homecage, open field, light/dark test, novel object, and rotarod. The tests were spaced so that there was at least a full week between one test and the next.</p> </div> <div class="shirpaprocedure" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The protocol began with the observation of undisturbed behaviour in a cylindrical viewing jar (15 × 12.5 cm), followed by transfer to an arena (35 w × 50 l × 18 h cm divided into fifteen 10 × 10 cm squares), a series of tail manipulations and use of a grid to measure grip strength and righting reflex. The following variables were recorded during the protocol: body position, spontaneous activity, respiration rate, presence of tremor, urination, transfer arousal, palpebral closing, piloerection, gait, pelvic elevation, tail elevation, startle response, escape response to touch, tail suspension (trunk curl, limb grasp and visual placing), grip strength, wire manoeuvre, righting reflex, negative geotaxis, fear, irritability, aggression and vocalization. For each variable, a range was defined and a score was assigned to each mouse according to its performance by a single observer who remained blind to their genotype. In addition, the number of faecal boli, the number of rearing events in the arena, and general locomotor activity (defined as number of squares entered by all four paws in 30 seconds) were recorded during the protocol.</p> </div> <div class="light/darkbox" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

The larger chamber was brightly lit (100 lux) using an overhead lamp, while the smaller chamber was dimly illuminated (15 lux). The experimental protocol was based on Bourin &amp;amp; Hascoët (2003)<sup><a href="#CR31">31</a></sup>. Mice were placed in the dark compartment and their movement recorded over five minutes using a camera positioned above the apparatus. Mean velocity (cm per second) and total distance (cm) covered in each compartment were extracted from the recordings using the EthoVision tracking software (EthoVision, Noldus Information Technologies, Wageningen, The Netherlands). In addition, the latency to enter, the number of entries into (defined as all four paws in one compartment) and the time spent in, each compartment were manually scored by an observer who was blind to the sex and genotype of each mouse.

Their movements and location throughout the duration of the test were recorded using a camera positioned overhead. The recordings were analysed with EthoVision. A square "inner" zone measuring 20 × 20 cm was virtually drawn in the centre of the open field by the tracking software, with the remaining boundary area adjacent to the arena walls defined as the "outer" zone. Variables extracted by the software from the test recordings included distance and speed travelled across the outer and inner zones; total entries and total time spent in each zone and latency to enter the inner zone.

Home cage monitoring</div> <p id="Par36">The experimental protocol was adapted from Mill <i>et al</i>.<sup><a href="#CR32">32</a></sup>. Locomotor activity was recorded for two hours in the middle of the dark phase of the light/dark cycle using a camera positioned above the test arenas, with the testing room illuminated by six red multi-LED cluster lamps (No. 310-6757; RS Components Northants, UK of approximate wavelength 705 nm) which provided minimal light for recording during the dark phase. Mice were filmed in their home cage with the cage lid replaced by a clear acrylic lid containing breathing holes. Petri dishes containing wetted food pellets were placed in each cage to provide food and water during the recording period, and the mice were habituated to the dishes for three consecutive days before being filmed. The recordings were analysed using EthoVision, from which the following variables were derived: total distance moved, average speed, heading, turn angle, angular velocity and meander.</p> </div> <div class="novelobjectexploration" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Novel object exploration</div> <p id="Par37">The tests were performed in a clean home cage with a standard amount of sawdust bedding and a regular cage lid, without food pellets or water bottle. Low red light illumination was provided with multi-LED cluster lamps to allow for effective capture of movement during the test. Activity was recorded with a camera in a lateral position to the cage. Mice were habituated to the cage for 20 minutes, after which an unfamiliar object (a rectangular wooden bar, 1 cm × 1 cm × 4.5 cm) was introduced into one end of the cage. The behaviour was recorded for 10 minutes. The following variables were manually scored from the recordings by an observer who was blind to the sex and genotype of each mouse: latency to object displacement, total object exploration time, number of exploration episodes (defined as direct contact between the muzzle and the object), total cage lid bar climbing time and number of cage lid bar climbing episodes.</p> </div> <div class="acceleratingrotarodtest" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Accelerating rotarod test</div> <p id="Par38">The test was performed using an Ugo Basile 7650 accelerating rotarod apparatus (Linton Instruments, Diss, UK) programmed to accelerate from 4 rpm to 40 rpm over a period of 300 s. Each mouse was placed on the rotating drum and allowed to habituate for 20 seconds at the baseline speed before starting the acceleration protocol. The variable recorded was the time (in seconds) it took for each mouse to fall off the rotating barrel after initiation of the protocol. If a mouse failed to fall off at the end of the test, its latency was recorded as 300 s. Each session took place during the light phase of the cycle and consisted of three individual trials. The mice underwent a total of four test sessions during four consecutive days.</p> </div> <div class="statisticalanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Statistical analysis</div> <p id="Par39">Two-way ANOVA with genotype and sex as the independent factors was used to assess the statistical significance of mean differences obtained from the raw data. In those cases in which a significant interaction between the two factors was observed, or both factors had a significant effect on the variable independent from each other, separate analyses of each factor were performed using unpaired, two tailed Student’s t-tests. Chi-square tests were used for assessing significant differences between proportions. Data from the rotarod test was analysed by performing a non-linear regression to determine the optimal curve fit followed by a standard linear regression. For an assessment of the normal distribution of the data both the D’Agostino-Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk test were taken into account and the Grubbs method was used to identify outliers. All the calculations were performed using the PRISM 7 statistical package (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA).</p> </div> <div class="dataavailability" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
