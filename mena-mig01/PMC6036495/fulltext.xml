The present study examined the role of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (RAC1) and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) in breast cancer cell migration. According to data in Kaplan, Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas, increased expression levels of RAC1 and VASP in breast cancer are associated with decreased cancer cell differentiation, advanced pathological stage and more aggressive tumor subtypes, while increased VASP mRNA expression levels are positively correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. The short hairpin (sh)RNA technique was employed to knock down the expression of RAC1 or VASP. Stable interference with the expression of RAC1 or VASP using RAC1-shRNA or VASP-shRNA, respectively, was established in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. In RAC1-shRNA or VASP-shRNA cells, the protein expression levels of RAC1 or VASP were significantly downregulated compared with control cells. The proliferation and migration rates of the RAC1-shRNA or VASP-shRNA cells were significantly lower compared with control cells. It was observed that the protein expression levels of VASP also decreased in RAC1-shRNA cells compared with control cells. The results revealed that RAC1 and VASP may serve important roles in promoting the migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and that VASP may among the downstream signaling molecules associated with RAC1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MCF-7</kwd><kwd>Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1</kwd><kwd>vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein</kwd><kwd>breast cancer cell</kwd><kwd>migration</kwd><kwd>short hairpin RNA</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to Chinese cancer statistics in 2015 (<xref rid="b1-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), thyroid cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type in women aged &#x0003c;30 years, followed by breast cancer at age 30&#x02013;59 years. Invasion and metastasis are the leading causes of mortality in patients with breast cancer (<xref rid="b2-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Therefore, in addition to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy treatments, finding effective ways to improve the treatment of patients with cancer is of primary concern.</p><p>Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a member of the Enabled (Ena)/VASP family, is an actin-associated protein. VASP is mainly distributed at locations associated with adhesion and migration, including the anterior border of the lamellar parapodium, filopodia cacumen and adhesion plaque, and has a highly dynamic position in the cellular membrane (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It is involved in regulating actin filament rearrangement in the process of cell adhesion and expansion, and is associated with cell adhesion, cytomorphosis and mobility (<xref rid="b4-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). According to Krause <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), an increase in VASP expression promotes the movement of the <italic>Listeria</italic> bacteria <italic>in vitro</italic>. VASP induces the assembling of actin via binding of ActA, which accelerates the movement of the <italic>Listeria</italic> bacterium inside cells. Furthermore, Sechi <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) reported that deleting the domain of ActA that directly combines with VASP, effectively suppresses the movement of the <italic>Listeria</italic> bacterium inside cells. In eukaryotic cells, the expression levels of VASP are positively correlated with the formation speed of lamellipodia in mouse melanoma B16-F1 cells (<xref rid="b6-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Notably, overexpression of VASP in wild-type NIH 3T3 cells resulted in malignant transformation of the cells (<xref rid="b7-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It has also been revealed that increased expression levels of VASP are correlated with decreased cellular differentiation and an increased pathological stage of lung tumors (<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These data suggested that VASP may serve a crucial role in regulating cellular migration, in addition to tumorigenesis and development.</p><p>Rho GTPases [Rho, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac)1 and cell division control protein 42 homolog (Cdc42)] are important signaling molecules that are involved in regulating cell migration through cellular cytoskeletal rearrangement (<xref rid="b9-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The activation of RAC1, one member of the family, promotes the recruitment of the integrin family, participates in the assembling of the cytoskeleton, and induces the accumulation and polarization of tumor invasion (<xref rid="b11-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, as a key factor in the regulation of cell migration, the relative contribution of RAC1 to cytoskeletal rearrangement depends on specific conditions and cell type. It was revealed that there were no significant changes in cellular migratory abilities in RAC1-deficient rat fibroblasts and macrophages (<xref rid="b12-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, downregulation of RAC1 was demonstrated to result in the inhibition of migration in various types of cells, including gastric, testicular and colorectal carcinoma cells (<xref rid="b13-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Notably, regarding the association between RAC1 and VASP, Fryer <italic>et al</italic> (<xref rid="b14-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) reported that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HeLa cells, p21-activated kinase (PAK; serine 21), a downstream molecule of RAC1 phosphorylated by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), promoted the formation of Pak/VASP and thereby affected cell motility.</p><p>Therefore, the present study focused on examining the role of RAC1 and VASP in the development of breast cancer, by analyzing data in Kaplan, Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and using <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Online databases</title><p>Patients with breast cancer were divided into a low expression level group and a high expression level group, according to the median RAC1 or VASP mRNA expression levels (<xref rid="b15-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).

Rho GTPases act as molecular switches that regulate numerous features of cell behavior, including cell polarity, cytokinesis, particle movement, membrane trafficking, membrane transport and translocation, cell growth and transformation, and cell adhesion and motility (<xref rid="b21-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Members of the Rho family affect cell morphology by controlling the formation of actin-dependent structures (<xref rid="b23-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). RhoA is involved in the assembly of tonofibrils, RAC1 regulates the formation of lamellipodia and membrane wrinkling, and Cdc42 promotes the formation of filopodia in vascular endothelial cells (<xref rid="b23-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Rho GTPases regulate carcinogenesis and tumor development (<xref rid="b24-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The mRNA and protein expression levels of RhoE have been demonstrated to be markedly increased in lung cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor lung tissues, and the overexpression of RhoE in non-small cell lung cancer has been associated with smoking (<xref rid="b25-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This suggests that RhoE may serve as a molecular marker to identify high-risk individuals for lung carcinogenesis. Increased RAC1 activity has been observed, in addition to the overexpression of PAK1, in urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract, tumor tissue and metastatic lymph node tissue (<xref rid="b26-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This was associated with poor differentiation, local infiltration and lymph node metastasis. In view of this, the purpose of the present study was to further examine the association between RAC1 and the development of breast cancer.</p><p>Downstream effectors of activated RAC1 include a variety of actin-associated proteins, which enable actin filament polymerization at the edge of the cell lamellipodia (<xref rid="b27-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The formation of the microfilament network includes nucleation, the extension of the filament at the positive end, and branching and dissociation at the negative end. RAC1 interacts with insulin receptor substrate p53 and the wave protein to activate the actin-related protein 2/3 complex to induce actin branch formation (<xref rid="b28-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition, RAC1 activates PAK1 to allow it to form a complex with, and phosphorylate, LIM domain kinase (<xref rid="b29-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). LIM-kinase catalyzes phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue of cofilin, thereby inactivating its F-actin-depolymerizing activity, and leading to the accumulation of actin filaments and aggregates. These results suggest that RAC1/Cdc42 promotes the formation of pseudopodia and promotes cell migration by promoting actin filament polymerization and inhibition of actin filament depolymerization (<xref rid="b30-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, as an actin-associated protein, the role of VASP in regulating the cytoskeleton is to promote the extension of actin filaments at the positive end, which is a crucial step for the formation of actin networks. Notably, there exists evidence for the presence of Ena/VASP family members (Mena, VASP and Ena-VASP-like) in the development of solid cancer (<xref rid="b31-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). The intensity of Mena expression increases from premalignant to malignant lesions in various organs, including the large bowel, stomach, cervix and salivary glands (<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b32-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Aggressive and migratory Mg-63 osteosarcoma cells contain comparatively higher expression levels of VASP at the transcriptional and translational levels, compared with the less aggressive Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells (<xref rid="b33-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Overexpression of VASP in wild-type NIH 3T3 cells results in metaplasia to cancer cells (<xref rid="b34-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and the increased expression level of VASP in lung adenocarcinoma correlates with lower cellular differentiation and an increased pathological stage of the tumor (<xref rid="b8-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that RAC1/VASP participates in the development of breast cancer, and research was initiated to provide clinical evidence.</p><p>The present study used information from multiple databases to comprehensively analyze the association between RAC1 and VASP mRNA expression levels in breast cancer tissues and the pathological features of the patients. According to data from Oncomine, the mRNA expression levels of RAC1 and VASP in invasive ductal carcinoma tissues were significantly increased compared with control tissues. Furthermore, according to the Kaplan-Meier data, the mortality rate of patients with breast cancer at 50 months in the RAC1 higher expression level group (49%) was increased compared with the lower expression group (40.2%). The mortality rate of patients with breast cancer at 50 months in the high VASP expression level group was significantly increased compared with the low expression group. Furthermore, according to the data from TCGA, mRNA expression levels of RAC1 and VASP in the Normal group were the lowest, and increased gradually in the Luminal A, Luminal B, BLBC and Her-2 enrichment subtype groups. The mRNA expression levels of RAC1 and VASP gradually increased in breast cancer tissues of stages I, II, III and IV. These data indicate that the high expression levels of RAC1 and VASP in breast cancer are associated with low cellular differentiation, high pathological stage and more aggressive tumor subtypes. High VASP mRNA expression levels were positively associated with a poor overall survival time in patients with breast cancer. However, the mechanism of RAC1/VASP function in the progression of breast cancer development requires further investigation and remains to be fully elucidated.</p><p>For further examination of the role of RAC1 and VASP in the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells, RAC1 or VASP-knockdown cell lines established. In the RAC1-shRNA or VASP-shRNA MCF-7 cells, the protein expression levels of RAC1 and VASP were downregulated, the proliferation rates were decreased and the migratory abilities decreased. These data indicated that RAC1 and VASP promoted breast cancer progression and development. Notably, it was observed that the protein expression level of VASP was decreased in RAC1-shRNA MCF-7 cells. However, the mechanism through which RAC1 regulates VASP remains unclear. PAK is a RAC1 downstream target molecule, and when the its serine 21 site is phosphorylated by PKG, PAK/NCK binding is inhibited and PAK/VASP binding is enhanced, in order to promote human umbilical vein endothelial cell motility (<xref rid="b30-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The binding takes place between the proline-rich region of PAK and the EVH1 domain of VASP (<xref rid="b3-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b35-ol-0-0-8930" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). These data may act as a foundation on which further investigations may be based.</p><p>In conclusion, RAC1 and VASP may act as proto-oncogenes in the development of breast cancer, and VASP may act as a downstream target of RAC1 to promote the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not
