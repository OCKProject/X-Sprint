Semaphorins comprise a large family of proteins with important roles in many of these processes, coordinated with the families of their receptor proteins, neuropilins and plexins [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The transmembrane Semaphorin-6 subclass consists of four members, which interact directly with members of the Plexin-A subclass. Of these, Semaphorin-6A (Sema6A) and Semaphorin-6B (Sema6B) form a cognate subgroup with Plexin-A2 (PlxnA2) and Plexin-A4 (PlxnA4). Genetic studies have revealed context-dependent interactions between members of this group, which control processes of cell migration, axon guidance and neuropil organization in various parts of the developing nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sema6A signals cell-non-autonomously via PlxnA2 on responding cells to initiate a switch in migratory mode in cerebellar granule cells [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and to restrict motor neuron cell bodies from exiting the ventral nerve root in the spinal cord [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sema6A signals via PlxnA4, to confine corticospinal projections [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and to establish laminar connectivity in the retina [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the developing hippocampus, signals from both Sema6A and Sema6B restrict mossy fibre projections via PlxnA4 [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In addition to trans interactions across cells, <italic>cis</italic> interactions are also important. In the hippocampus, PlxnA2 co-expression in the target zone antagonizes Sema6A-PlxnA4 signaling and defines a permissive zone for mossy fibre projection and synapse formation [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>Cis</italic> interactions between Sema6A and PlxnA2 may also be important in controlling dendritic arborization of retinal ganglion cells [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Direct binding in <italic>cis</italic> has also been demonstrated between Sema6A and PlxnA4. In sensory neurons, co-expression of Sema6A inhibits the response of PlxnA4 to Sema6A in trans, thus making these neurons insensitive to this cue, unlike sympathetic neurons, which normally express only PlxnA4 [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The fact that the four proteins in this cognate group are often co-expressed suggests that such <italic>cis</italic> interactions may contribute significantly to the combinatorial logic of their functions in other contexts.</p><p>Signaling may also occur in a bidirectional manner between these proteins. Interactions in the canonical &#x0201c;forward&#x0201d; direction, with Sema6A or Sema6B as the ligand and PlxnA2 and/or PlxnA4 in the responding cells, cannot readily account for all the phenotypes observed in animals with mutations in these genes, many of which are apparent in axons normally expressing Sema6A [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or co-expressing Sema6A and PlxnA2 [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, there are several known examples of related transmembrane semaphorins that can also signal in the &#x0201c;reverse&#x0201d; direction, mediating cell-autonomous responses to exogenous cues.</p><p>In Drosophila, Sema1a, the orthologue of the Sema6 family, acts as a receptor for Plexin-A (PlexA) in the guidance of photoreceptor axons [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the olfactory system, Sema1a acts as a ligand for PlexA to control targeting of odorant receptor neuron axons [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but as a receptor for the secreted semaphorins Sema2a and Sema2b to control dendritic targeting of projection neurons [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In development of giant fibre connectivity and motor axon projections, Sema1a signals in a bidirectional manner simultaneously [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], though the ligand that activates Sema1a reverse signaling in these contexts is unknown. Similarly, in vertebrates, Sema6D has been shown to signal in a bidirectional manner, acting as both ligand and receptor for PlxnA1 during heart development [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Information on the downstream signaling pathways is more limited for semaphorin reverse signaling than for forward signaling through plexin and neuropilin receptors [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In flies, an interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of Sema1a and the cytoskeletal regulator protein Enabled (Ena) is required for reverse signaling [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sema1a signals are also transmitted via regulators of Rho family small GTPases [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] to control axon guidance. Interactions in <italic>cis</italic> with the L1 orthologue neuroglian may modulate Sema1a receptor function [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In vertebrates, Sema6D activation leads to recruitment of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Abl to the Sema6D cytoplasmic domain and phosphorylation of Ena [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Sema6A has been shown to bind the Ena paralogue, Evl [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and computational analysis strongly predicts an Abl-binding site in the Sema6A cytoplasmic domain [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Both the Abl and Ena/Evl-binding site sequences are highly conserved between Sema6A and Sema6D. Finally, Sema6B has been reported to bind the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Src [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Crystal structures have illustrated the mechanism whereby binding of Sema6A activates forward signaling through PlxnA2 [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Sema6A dimers independently bind two PlxnA2 monomers, followed by higher-order clustering in the membrane, possibly mediated by <italic>cis</italic> dimerization of PlxnA2 through the membrane-proximal IPT domains or intracellular regions [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] or trimerization in a complex with a RhoGTPase [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This clustering activates PlxnA2 intracellular signaling, but whether it also activates signaling in the reverse direction, through the Sema6A cytoplasmic domain, remains unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that Sema6A is capable of reverse signaling, both constitutively and in response to either PlxnA2-binding or chemically induced multimerisation. Activation of Sema6A stimulates phosphorylation of numerous downstream signaling proteins, including Abl kinase, which is recruited to the Sema6A cytoplasmic domain on ligand binding. Sema6A reverse signaling affects the shape of non-neuronal cells and aggregation and neurite formation of neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>. Sema6A also interacts with PlxnA2 in <italic>cis</italic>, which reduces binding by PlxnA2 of Sema6A in <italic>trans</italic> but not vice versa. These experiments reveal the complex nature of Sema6A biochemical functions and begin to dissect the molecular logic of the context-dependent interactions between Sema6A and PlxnA2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sema6A signals cell-autonomously in NIH3T3 cells and confers responsiveness to PlxnA2</title><p>To address the potential cell-autonomous functions of Sema6A we performed transfection of Sema6A in NIH3T3 cells.

These results indicate the Sema6A homodimer has a constitutive cell-autonomous activity in mouse cells under these conditions. Incubation of 60-100nM of PlxnA2 extracellular domain (PlxnA2-EC) had no effect on untransfected cells but on cells expressing Sema6A-FL promoted internalization of Sema6A in vesicle-like structures, together with a reduction of membrane protrusions and cellular contraction, along with collapse of F-actin (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158686.g001">1B, 1E, 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158686.s001">S1A&#x02013;S1F</xref>).

Indeed, PlxnA2-EC caused a slight but statistically significant increase in area of cells expressing Sema6B.

This signaling induces recruitment and phosphorylation of Abl tyrosine kinase and the phosphorylation of additional cytoplasmic signaling proteins, many involved in cytoskeletal regulation. Activation of Sema6A has multiple effects on non-neuronal and neuronal cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, influencing cell morphology, neurite growth and cellular aggregation.</p><p>In NIH3T3 fibroblast cells, expression of full-length Sema6A induces a change in cell shape, with an increase in surface area and in membrane complexity, with numerous filopodia apparent. It also confers responsiveness to the extracellular domain of PlxnA2. PlxnA2 has no effect on untransfected or GFP-transfected cells but induces cellular collapse of cells transfected with full-length Sema6A. By contrast, cells transfected with a mutant form of Sema6A that does not bind PlxnA2 show the increase in cellular area and complexity but no response to PlxnA2. These data suggest that not only can Sema6A initiate reverse signaling&#x02013;it can do it in two distinct modes. The fact that the effects of stimulated and unstimulated signaling are qualitatively distinct, perhaps even opposite to each other, argues against the idea that constitutive signaling is merely due to over-expression. We speculate that these two modes may reflect signaling by unclustered dimers of Sema6A versus multimerised clusters induced by ligand binding.</p><p>We used an assay with cerebellar granule cell explants to assess Sema6A signaling in a more physiological context. Our data clearly demonstrate that activation of endogenous Sema6A in neurons, by exposure to PlxnA2, stimulates two distinct effects. First, explants grown on NIH3T3 cells expressing PlxnA2 are strongly disaggregated, an effect that depends on Sema6A activity in the responding cells. This disaggregation likely reflects an alteration of paracrine interactions between cerebellar granule cells. If Sema6A activation mediated a typical repulsive signal, one might expect a tighter aggregation of the explant as Sema6A-positive cells avoided the PlxnA2-expressing substrate. Instead, exposure to PlxnA2 from the substrate alters interactions <italic>between</italic> cerebellar granule cells, suggesting that Sema6A activation may feed back to the cell surface, regulating mutual repulsion or levels of adhesion.</p><p>Second, in dissociated cerebellar granule neurons, activation of Sema6A signaling has effects on neurite outgrowth and complexity. Wild-type neurons grown on sheets of PlxnA2-expressing cells have reduced axonal and dendritic length and number of branches. <italic>Sema6A</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> neurons are insensitive to PlxnA2, but transfection of a construct encoding full-length Sema6A restores responsiveness. The fact that a construct of Sema6A lacking the cytoplasmic domain not only cannot signal but acts as a dominant-negative further reinforces the conclusion that these effects involve signaling through the Sema6A cytoplasmic domain. This is directly demonstrated by the fact that chemically induced multimerisation of the membrane-tethered Sema6A cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to induce similar effects on neurite outgrowth in dissociated neurons.</p><p>Our biochemical assays have identified a number of downstream events following Sema6A activation, involving phosphorylation of multiple proteins with functions in cytoskeletal regulation. The most direct interaction is with the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Abl, which acts as an intermediary between transmembrane receptors and the cytoskeleton, affecting cellular morphology, adhesion and migration [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Sema6A activation by ligand binding leads to recruitment of Abl kinase to the cytoplasmic domain and to Abl phosphorylation. We show, using a deletion construct, that Abl recruitment is required for PlxnA2-induced cellular collapse of NIH3T3 cells, suggesting it is a proximal event in Sema6A ligand-induced reverse signaling, though this role remains to be demonstrated directly in neurons. It is not however required for the increase in cellular area and complexity that accompanies full-length Sema6A expression, providing additional evidence for a biochemically distinct, constitutive mode of reverse signaling by Sema6A.</p><p>The Sema6A cytoplasmic domain also directly interacts with the Abl substrate Mena, in a manner that is independent of ligand binding. The functional relevance of this interaction remains to be tested, but an important role in regulating adhesion or migration would be consistent with known functions of Ena/VASP proteins [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and with the implication of both Abl and Enabled orthologues in reverse signaling by Sema6D and Sema1a [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The Rho signaling modulators p190RhoGAP and pebble (a RhoGEF) have also recently been implicated in Sema1a reverse signaling in Drosophila, through direct interactions with the cytoplasmic domain [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interestingly, p190RhoGAP is a substrate for the Abl orthologue, Arg, suggesting a possible interaction between these signaling pathways to regulate Rho1 activity and coordinate effects on the cytoskeleton or on adhesion [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Sema6A activation also triggers phosphorylation of a number of other cytoskeleton-regulating cytoplasmic proteins, including p130CAS [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], MARCKS [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], ezrin, radixin and moesin [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and GSK3-alpha [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These molecules have well-documented effects on cellular morphology, adhesion, neurite outgrowth, branching or guidance (see reviews referenced above). Many of these pathways have known interactions with Abl signaling in regulation of actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements with diverse cellular effects [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, the functional roles and relationships of these various proteins in the cellular events induced by Sema6A reverse signaling remain to be determined.</p><p>In addition to identifying functional bidirectional signaling arising from Sema6A-PlxnA2 <italic>trans</italic> interaction, we also observe interactions <italic>in cis</italic> between these molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158686.g008">Fig 8</xref>). These are mediated by the extracellular domains but do not depend on the same interfaces as <italic>trans</italic> interactions, as amino acid mutations that block <italic>trans</italic> interactions leave <italic>cis</italic> interactions intact. Nevertheless, the <italic>cis</italic> interactions can interfere with the <italic>trans</italic> interactions: co-expression of Sema6A <italic>in cis</italic> blocks the ability of PlxnA2 to bind Sema6A-EC in <italic>trans</italic>. Evidence for a similar effect was recently observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the developing retina [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and it is similar to the previously described effect on PlxnA4 [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The converse was not observed however; Sema6A could bind PlxnA2-EC in <italic>trans</italic> and Abl could be consequently recruited to the Sema6A cytoplasmic domain, regardless of the presence or absence of PlxnA2 in <italic>cis</italic>. In the opposite direction, co-expression of PlxnA2 in <italic>cis</italic> has been proposed to disrupt Sema6A function as a ligand, with PlxnA2 expression masking the repulsive effects of Sema6A and Sema6B and restricting hippocampal mossy fiber projections to a specific layer [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0158686.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

(<bold>D</bold>) In populations of cells expressing both Sema6A and PlxnA2, the complexes should act as receptors for PlxnA2, through reverse signaling by Sema6A (blue arrows). The balance between these various interactions will likely depend on the precise stoichiometry of the proteins and may also be dynamically altered by interactions with additional proteins or newly encountered cells (e.g., ref. [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0158686.g008"/></fig><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that heteromeric Sema6A-PlxnA2 complexes should present PlxnA2 (but not Sema6A) as a ligand to other cells but should function as receptors through reverse signaling by Sema6A (but not through PlxnA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158686.g008">Fig 8</xref>). A recent study of the functions of these genes in the retina supports this model [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sema6A and PlxnA2 are co-expressed in ON starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and both are required for dendritic self-avoidance. The authors confirm that Sema6A is repulsive for neurites of SACs expressing PlxnA2 alone (mediating segregation of ON and OFF SAC dendrites) but not SACs expressing both PlxnA2 and Sema6A. If PlxnA2 cannot act as a receptor when Sema6A is expressed <italic>in cis</italic>, this suggests instead that Sema6A may function as the signaling receptor for self-avoidance, responding to PlxnA2 as the ligand in neighboring dendrites.</p><p>More direct evidence of Sema6A reverse signaling in vivo was very recently described by the same authors, who showed that Sema6A is required in a subset of retinal ganglion cells as a receptor for PlxnA2 and PlxnA4, to promote correct innervation by these axons of the medial temporal nucleus (MTN) [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>Finally, a recent study in the developing spinal cord illustrates a similar scenario, in this case involving Sema6B and PlxnA2 [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Commissural neurons express Sema6B, which acts as a receptor for PlxnA2 expressed by the floorplate, with this interaction promoting midline crossing. PlxnA2 is co-expressed in cis by commissural neurons but does not block the response to exogenous PlxnA2. However, PlxnA2 is prevented by the cis interaction with Sema6B from responding prematurely to the secreted semaphorin Sema3A. When Sema6B binds PlxnA2 from the floorplate in trans, this cis interaction is disrupted and PlxnA2 becomes an active receptor for Sema3A, which ensures accurate post-crossing projections.</p><p>The findings we present here provide a biochemical framework for the mechanisms underlying these complex and context-dependent interactions. The Sema6 and PlxnA proteins do not fall into neat ligand-receptor categories but exhibit a much more intricate and combinatorial molecular logic, often simultaneously mediating multiple cellular interactions: between different cell types, among groups of cells or nerve fibres through paracrine interactions or even across neurites from the same cell. The biochemical activities we have defined will inform the interpretation of mutant phenotypes for these genes in the expanding list of regions where they play important roles [<xref rid="pone.0158686.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All animal work was approved by the Ethics Committee of Trinity College Dublin and the animal licence to KJM (Ref.
