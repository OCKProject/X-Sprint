To better understand its function and regulation, we used biochemical methods to identify the DnaJ homolog subfamily A member 1 (DjA1) as a novel GRASP65-binding protein. In cells, depletion of DjA1 resulted in Golgi fragmentation, short and improperly aligned cisternae, and delayed Golgi reassembly after nocodazole washout. In vitro, immunodepletion of DjA1 from interphase cytosol reduced its activity to enhance GRASP65 oligomerization and Golgi membrane fusion, while adding purified DjA1 enhanced GRASP65 oligomerization. DjA1 is a cochaperone of Heat shock cognate 71-kDa protein (Hsc70), but the activity of DjA1 in Golgi structure formation is independent of its cochaperone activity or Hsc70, rather, through DjA1-GRASP65 interaction to promote GRASP65 oligomerization. Thus, DjA1 interacts with GRASP65 to enhance Golgi structure formation through the promotion of GRASP65 <italic>trans</italic>-oligomerization.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The Golgi apparatus is a central intracellular membrane organelle responsible for trafficking and modification of proteins and lipids. In mammalian cells, the Golgi is characterized by stacks of five to seven flattened cisternae, which are laterally linked into a ribbon-like structure (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Lowe, 2011</xref>) adjacent to the centrosome and the nucleus. The Golgi structure is highly dynamic and undergoes rapid disassembly and reassembly during mitosis, or under stress and pathological conditions (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Seemann, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Huang and Wang, 2017</xref>). Numerous Golgi matrix proteins, including the <underline>G</underline>olgi <underline>R</underline>e-<underline>A</underline>ssembly <underline>S</underline>tacking <underline>P</underline>roteins GRASP65 and GRASP55 (GRASPs, also called GORASP1 and GORASP2, respectively) and golgins, have been demonstrated to work together to maintain normal Golgi structure and function (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xiang and Wang, 2010</xref>). However, the exact mechanisms of Golgi structure formation remain largely unknown.</p><p>GRASP55/65 are peripheral proteins targeted to the cytoplasmic face of Golgi membranes by myristoylation and concentrated at the interface between the cisternae where stacking occurs (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Shorter <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimura <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Both GRASPs contain a conserved N-terminal GRASP domain and a C-terminal serine/proline-rich (SPR) domain (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Wang, 2015</xref>). Several groups have reported their roles in Golgi stacking and ribbon-linking (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barr <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Puthenveedu <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Veenendaal <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), as well as cargo transportation, unconventional secretion, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and cell migration (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Lane <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Ramirez and Lowe, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Wei and Seemann, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Vinke <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Ji <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Wang, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). GRASPs from adjacent Golgi cisternae form <italic>trans</italic>-oligomers through the N-terminal GRASP domain and tether the cisternae into a stack (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Depletion of either GRASP65 or GRASP55 reduces the number of cisternae in the Golgi stack, while depletion of both GRASPs leads to disassembly of the entire Golgi stack (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sutterlin <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xiang and Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bekier <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). During mitosis, phosphorylation by Cdk1 and Plk1 inhibits GRASP65 oligomerization and leads to cisternal separation. At the end of mitosis, dephosphorylation by PP2A allows the reformation of GRASP <italic>trans</italic>-oligomers and stacking of newly formed cisternae (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010b</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xiang and Wang, 2010</xref>). GRASPs are also involved in Golgi ribbon linking, as depletion of either GRASP65 or GRASP55 results in Golgi ribbon unlinking (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Puthenveedu <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Feinstein and Linstedt, 2008</xref>).</p><p>One way to better understand the role of GRASP65 in Golgi structure formation is to identify its interacting proteins. Indeed, our group has recently identified the mammalian actin elongation factor Mena as a binding partner of GRASP65. We found that Mena is targeted to the Golgi through the interaction with GRASP65 to enhance Golgi ribbon linking via GRASP65 oligomerization and local actin polymerization (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). However, Mena is unlikely the sole modulator of GRASP65, as Mena mainly modulates GRASP65 in Golgi ribbon linking but has only mild effects on Golgi stack formation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), which indicates that additional, unidentified cytosolic proteins may also interact with GRASP65 and regulate its function in Golgi stacking. Therefore, we examined the mass spectrometry results previously used to discover Mena as a GRASP65-binding protein (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and identified a set of protein chaperones as novel GRASP65 interacting proteins, including DjA1 and Hsc70. Further investigation revealed that DjA1, but not Hsc70, directly interacts with GRASP65 and enhances GRASP65 oligomerization. This is the first report that a J-domain protein cochaperone modulates Golgi structure formation through GRASP65.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of DjA1 as a novel GRASP65 binding protein</title><p>In our previous studies, we devised a bead aggregation assay to demonstrate that GRASP65 could link adjacent cisternal surfaces (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).

Noticeably, the interaction of DjA1 and Hsc70 with interphase Golgi membranes was stronger than with mitotic Golgi membranes, which was previously shown by quantitative proteomic studies (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These results suggest a role of these proteins in maintaining the Golgi structure under interphase conditions. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that endogenous DjA1 was mostly cytosolically localized in cells as previously reported (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Terada and Mori, 2000</xref>), but with a higher concentration in the perinuclear region, which partially colocalized with GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, Hsc70 localized in the cytoplasm without detectable colocalization with GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). The Golgi localization of DjA1 and Hsc70 was more obvious when cells were permeabilized with saponin before fixation (Supplemental Figure 1).</p><p>To confirm the interaction among GRASP65, DjA1, and Hsc70, we incubated BSA- or GRASP65-coated cyanogen bromide&#x02013; (CNBr) activated beads with HeLa whole cell lysate (WCL) and analyzed bound proteins by Western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>, DjA1 and Hsc70 were copurified with GRASP65 from the WCL but not with BSA. Further experiments showed that endogenous DjA1 and Hsc70 coimmunoprecipitated with GRASP65 from the WCL when a GRASP65 antibody was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of DjA1 also brought down GRASP65-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1G</xref>). Nickel (Ni)-beads pull-down assay using purified His-tagged DjA1 or Hsc70 further confirmed the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>Considering that DjA1 has been reported to bind Hsc70 and functions as its cochaperone, we conducted an in vitro binding assay by incubating BSA- or GRASP65-coupled-CNBr beads with purified His-tagged DjA1, Hsc70, or both to determine whether the interactions between the three proteins were direct. The result showed that DjA1 directly bound to GRASP65 regardless of the presence of Hsc70, while Hsc70 weakly bound to GRASP65 only when DjA1 was present in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1I</xref>). This result suggests direct interaction between DjA1 and GRASP65 and therefore links Hsc70 to it. However, Hsc70 lacks direct interaction with GRASP65 in vitro. To clarify the specificity of the DjA1-GRASP65 interaction, we compared the affinities of DjA1 and DjA4, two Type 1 J-domain protein family members with similar structures (Supplemental Figure 2), with GRASP65 in parallel. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1J</xref>, only DjA1-, but not DjA4-, coupled beads pulled down GRASP65-GFP from HeLa cells lysate. Moreover, unlike GRASP65, GRASP55 was not pulled down by DjA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1K</xref>). Combined, these results indicate a specific interaction between GRASP65 and DjA1.</p></sec><sec><title>Mapping the DjA1 and GRASP65 interaction regions</title><p>To further understand the DjA1-GRASP65 interaction, we mapped the interaction regions on both proteins using the pull-down assay. Like other members in the Type 1 J-domain protein family, DjA1 contains an N-terminal J domain bearing the highly conserved histidine-proline-aspartic acid (HPD) tripeptide critical for the interaction with Hsc70 (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tsai and Douglas, 1996</xref>). Adjacent to the J-domain, there is a glycine/phenylalanine (G/F)-rich region followed by a central cysteine-rich region (CRR) consisting of four repeats of the CXXCXGXG Zinc finger motif, and then a C-terminal region involved in binding of client proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Lu and Cyr, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Borges <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).

After 60 min, all the Golgi elements were concentrated at the cell center in control cells, and the Golgi ribbon became intact in control cells. However, in DjA1-depleted cells, more Golgi elements remained unconnected. Quantitation results showed that DjA1 depletion increased the number of detectable Golgi elements per cell at multiple time points, indicating a defect in accumulation and fusion of the Golgi elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4:</label><caption><p>DjA1 depletion impairs Golgi ribbon formation after nocodazole washout.

On the basis of the literature, we speculated three possible roles for DjA1 (and Hsc70) on the Golgi. First, given that DjA1 and Hsc70 are well-established protein chaperones (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Terada and Mori, 2000</xref>), it is possible that they are recruited to the Golgi by GRASP65 and involved in Golgi structural protein folding, which could be a part of the Golgi protein quality control system. If this is the case, then depletion of DjA1 of Hsc70 could cause destabilization of some Golgi proteins. Therefore, we tested the protein levels of multiple key Golgi structural proteins by Western blotting. However, no significant change was detected in GRASP65 or other Golgi proteins (Supplemental Figure 5, lane 2 vs. lane 1).</p><p>It has been previously reported that clathrin cages are disassembled by Hsc70 and some of its J-domain containing cochaperones, such as cyclin-G&#x02013;associated kinase (GAK) and its neuronal-specific homolog auxilin (also known as DNAJC6) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Krantz <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Therefore, an alternative possibility is that DjA1 could be an unidentified Hsc70 cofactor in clathrin uncoating. However, DjA1 knockdown affected neither clathrin distribution in the cell nor the concentration of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) in the perinuclear region (Supplemental Figure 6A). Additionally, when purified Golgi membranes were incubated with purified DjA1, with or without Hsc70, and reisolated, the amount of Golgi-associated clathrin did not significant change (Supplemental Figure 6, B and C). These results ruled out the role of Hsc70 and DjA1 in the disassembly of the clathrin coat on Golgi membranes.</p><p>Exclusion of the first two hypotheses leaves the last possibility that DjA1 may modulate the Golgi structure through GRASP65, possibly via regulating its oligomerization. To test this possibility, we employed the bead aggregation assay that we established earlier (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In this assay, Dyna magnetic beads were first coated with purified GRASP65 at the surface, and further incubated with a buffer or cytosol. Interactions between GRASP65 molecules on different beads could bring the bead together to form aggregates, indicating the efficiency of GRASP65 oligomerization and its capability to link surfaces together as in Golgi stacking. Thus, bead aggregation can be used as a direct readout for GRASP65 oligomerization (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>), which was used here to study the role of DjA1 in GRASP65 oligomerization. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, A and B</xref>, GRASP65-coated beads formed large aggregates when incubated with IC, whereas blocking DjA1 using a DjA1-specific antibody significantly reduced this activity. Consistently, immunodepletion of DjA1 from IC significantly reduced GRASP65 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, C&#x02013;E</xref>), suggesting that DjA1 is a major component in the IC that enhances GRASP65 oligomerization. Moreover, adding back purified DjA1 full-length (DjA1FL) protein, or the fragments that interacted with GRASP65, including DjA1&#x02206;J and DjA1C, rescued this effect; whereas adding DjA1&#x00394;C, which does not interact with GRASP65, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, C and D</xref>). To confirm a direct role of DjA1 in GRASP65 oligomerization, we incubated GRASP65-coated beads with purified DjA1 fragments without cytosol. As expected, full-length DjA1 and its GRASP65-binding fragments directly enhanced aggregation of GRASP65-coated beads, although at a lower efficiency than complete IC. On the contrary, purified Hsc70 failed to induce GRASP65 oligomerization or to further enhance DjA1-induced GRASP65 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7, F and G</xref>).</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>FIGURE 7:</label><caption><p>DjA1 enhances GRASP65 oligomerization via direct interaction.

Adding full-length DjA1 enhanced the efficiency of the copurification. Furthermore, adding DjA1&#x02206;J or DjA1C, which interacts with GRASP65, had a similar effect as full-length DjA1; whereas adding DjA1&#x02206;C, which does not interact with GRASP65, had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7J</xref>). Taken together, our results demonstrate that DjA1 interacts with GRASP65 to enhance its oligomerization.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we identified a type I J domain protein, DjA1, as a novel interacting partner of the Golgi stacking protein GRASP65. DjA1 is involved in maintaining Golgi integrity via promoting GRASP65 oligomerization and membrane tethering. In vivo and in vitro binding assays revealed a direct interaction between DjA1 C-terminus and GRASP65 amino acids 202&#x02013;320 region in the SPR domain. Immunofluorescence and EM microscopy showed disrupted Golgi on DjA1 depletion, as Golgi stacks had shorter, irregularly shaped, less-well-stacked, and improperly aligned cisternae. In vitro bead aggregation and copurification assay supported that DjA1 promotes GRASP65 oligomerization. However, depletion of DjA1 impeded Golgi ribbon formation after nocodazole washout, which indicated that DjA1 may partially function in ribbon linking.</p><p>DjA1 was first identified as a novel GRASP65 interacting protein by affinity purification and mass spectrometry, and was subsequently shown to be associated with interphase Golgi membranes. Since its binding partner Hsc70 was identified at the same time, we originally raised three hypotheses in their roles in Golgi structure formation and function. First, considering that they are protein chaperones involved in protein folding (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Terada and Oike, 2010</xref>), we initially speculated that they may be recruited to the Golgi membranes by GRASP65 to function as part of the Golgi protein quality control system. However, subsequent experiments failed to detect an impact of DjA1 depletion on the level of several Golgi structural proteins (Supplemental Figure 5). Second, clathrin functions in vesicles budding from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) in the sorting of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes for delivery to the endosomal system (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Neuhaus, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Staudt <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), where Hsc70 and its J domain protein cofactors are required for clathrin uncoating (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ungewickell <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Greener <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). We therefore determined whether DjA1 and Hsc70 could function together in clathrin uncoating at the TGN. However, DjA1 depletion showed no significant effect on the Golgi localization of clathrin in cells (Supplemental Figure 6A). In addition, treatment of Golgi membranes with purified DjA1, with or without Hsc70, did not affect the association of clathrin with Golgi membranes (Supplemental Figure 6, B and C). Therefore, in the following studies we focused on their roles in GRASP65-related Golgi morphology regulation and later excluded the role of Hsc70 in this process.</p><p>A notable phenomenon seen in DjA1 knockdown cells was the misshaped and improperly aligned cisternae under the EM. Although it has been confirmed that DjA1 enhances GRASP65 oligomerization, the exact mechanism remains unknown. It is possible that DjA1 may affect the size of GRASP65 oligomers and the arrangement of GRASP65 molecules in them. Considering that DjA1 forms dimer while binding to its client proteins, DjA1 dimerization may provide a &#x0201c;tethering&#x0201d; effect between different GRASP65 molecules and therefore facilitates their assembly. Alternatively, DjA1 interaction with the SPR domain of GRASP65 may free the N-terminal GRASP domain for oligomerization. Consequently, DjA1 depletion may affect GRASP65 distribution and organization in the gap between the cisternae. It has been suggested that membrane adhesion dictates Golgi stacking and cisternal morphology (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that improper or uneven localization of GRASP65, or disorganization of GRASP65 molecules in the oligomers, may affect the morphology and organization of Golgi cisternal membranes in the stacks. Future structure studies of DjA1 and GRASP65 may shed light on the exact mechanism.</p><p>DjA1 depletion accelerates proteins trafficking, similarly to GRASP depletion (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xiang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). As a central hub of protein processing and trafficking, the function of the Golgi is tightly linked to its structure. Previously, we have shown that Golgi structure disruption by GRASP65 and GRASP55 double-depletion enhances the trafficking of VSV-G, integrin, and cathepsin D (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xiang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Microinjection of GRASP65 antibodies inhibits stacking and results in accelerated CD8 trafficking (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). One explanation is that Golgi unstacking increases the membrane surface and thus the efficiency of coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicle formation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Xiang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). As DjA1 depletion impairs Golgi stack formation, it is reasonable to speculate that it also accelerates protein trafficking, as seen in GRASP-depleted cells.</p><p>Although GRASP65 was originally identified as a Golgi stacking factor (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Barr <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Shorter <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), it was later reported to be also important in Golgi ribbon linking (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Puthenveedu <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Duran <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Feinstein and Linstedt, 2008</xref>). Both stacking and ribbon linking are mediated by GRASP65 <italic>trans</italic>-oligomers (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Tang and Wang, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, the size of GRASP65 <italic>trans</italic>-oligomers (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Feng <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) corresponds well with the gap between the cisternae of the Golgi stack, but is too small for the much larger and heterogeneous gap between stacks (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Cluett and Brown, 1992</xref>), suggesting the involvement of other bridging proteins in GRASP65-mediated ribbon formation. Indeed, our group has previously identified Mena as a GRASP65 interacting protein, which promotes local actin polymerization and facilitates Golgi ribbon linking. In the current study, DjA1 depletion results in shorter and fewer cisternae in the stacks, which is similar to the effect of single GRASP65 interference (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xiang and Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bekier <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) and indicates its function in cisternae stacking. Interestingly, knockdown of DjA1 has a relative more severe phenotype on Golgi morphology than knockdown or knockout of GRASP65 itself. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, one possibility is that it could be due to the compensation effect of GRASP55 in GRASP65- but not DjA1-depleted cells. As shown in Supplemental Figure 5, the level of GRASP55 increased in GRASP65 knockout but not DjA1-depleted cells. Because GRASP55 and GRASP65 play complementary roles in Golgi stacking (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Xiang and Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bekier <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), increased GRASP55 level may reduce or diminish the effect caused by GRASP65 depletion.</p><p>However, restrained ribbon formation after nocodazole washout was also observed after DjA1 depletion, which indicated its potential role in ribbon linking. However, given that stacking defects may subsequently affect ribbon linking, it is unknown at this time whether DjA1 directly affects ribbon linking via GRASP65 function in stacking. The possibility that DjA1 (and Hsc70) affects Golgi ribbon linking via collaboration with other (GRASP-related) factors can also not be excluded.</p><p>Although DjA1 has been established as a Hsc70 cochaperone, the results showing DjA1 functions independently of Hsc70 in Golgi structure maintenance are not surprising since DjA1 mainly cooperate with Hsc70 via its J-domain and accumulating reports have emerged to support the idea that J proteins do not &#x0201c;completely&#x0201d; rely on their J domains to carry out their cellular functions. In some cases, the J domain becomes dispensable (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Ajit Tamadaddi and Sahi, 2016</xref>). As for DjA1, Cao <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic> discovered that DjA1 associates with the bPB2 and PA subunits of the influenza A virus complex and enhances viral RNA synthesis; this function depends on its C-terminal substrate-binding domain but not Hsp70 (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cao <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that DjA1 interacts with GRASP65 to promote its oligomerization and Golgi structure formation, a novel function of DjA1 that is independent of Hsc70.</p><p>In summary, we have identified that DjA1 directly interacts with GRASP65 to enhance GRASP65 oligomerization and facilitates Golgi stack and ribbon formation. Together with our previous research, this study further confirms GRASP65 as a multifaceted protein in Golgi structure formation through oligomerization and interaction with an array of binding proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents, plasmids, antibodies, and siRNA</title><p>All reagents were purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ), EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA), Roche (Mannheim, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Paso Robles, CA), and Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA), unless otherwise stated.

For DjA1 knockdown and rescue, cells were transfected with DjA1-specific siRNA for 48 h and then with either an EGFP-C1 vector or the siRNA-resistant mutant of GFP-DjA1 for another 24 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of GRASP65-interacting proteins</title><p>This was done as previously (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Tang <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Briefly, interphase HeLa cell cytosol was diluted to 1 mg/ml and precipitated with 15% ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation in a bench-top minicentrifuge at full speed for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C, the supernatant was increased to 30% ammonium sulfate followed by centrifugation as above. Proteins in the pellet were dissolved and dialyzed into KHM buffer (20 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES]&#x02013;KOH, pH 7.0, 0.2 M sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, 1 mM glutathione, and protease inhibitors). Dissolved proteins were incubated with BSA or His-GRASP65-coupled, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma-Aldrich) in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (ARS) (10 mM creatine phosphate, 1 mM ATP, 20 &#x003bc;g/ml creatine kinase, and 20 ng/ml cytochalasin B) in KHM buffer at 4&#x000b0;C overnight following manufacture&#x02019;s instruction. The beads were washed extensively and boiled in SDS buffer. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Specific bands that appeared in the lane of GRASP65 beads but not in the BSA beads were analyzed by mass spectrometry (Proteomics and Peptide Synthesis Core, University of Michigan) and searched against International Protein Index human databases as previously described (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of recombinant proteins</title><p>All the recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) Gold bacteria with induction performed on cultures (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.6) at 25&#x000b0;C overnight with 0.5 mM Isopropyl &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). His-tagged GRASP65 full-length, DjA1 full-length and fragments were purified using HisPurTM Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). GST-tagged GRASP65 fragments were purified on glutathione&#x02013;SepharoseTM 4B Resin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA).

In brief, purified GRASP65 full-length or N-terminal fragment was coupled onto the surface of Dynabeads M-500 Subcellular or M-450 Tosylactivated (Invitrogen). The coupled beads were then incubated with IC or purified proteins as indicated in the presence of an ARS at 37&#x000b0;C with rotation for 1 h. The beads were then submitted for imaging and quantitation. Random phase contrast digital images (10&#x02013;20) of each sample were captured using Zeiss Observer Z1 epifluorescence microscope with a 10&#x000d7; lens. Images from three independent experiments were analyzed using MATLAB7.4 software to determine the surface area of objects, which was used to calculate the number of beads in the clusters. Aggregates were defined as those with six or more beads. For immunodepletion of DjA1, IC prepared from HeLa S3 cells (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Rabouille <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) was incubated with nonspecific control IgG or DjA1 antibody (ProteinTech) and protein A-agarose beads at 4&#x000b0;C overnight.
