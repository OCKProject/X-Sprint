  <result pre="from the migration-security theoretical review above-mentioned, namely: (i) presence of" exact="migration" post="issues when characterising the global security environment; (ii) immigration"/>
  <result pre="a risk to national security; (iii) security of (im)migrants; (iv)" exact="migration" post="feedback effects with other risks and threats; (v) emigration"/>
  <result pre="security; and (vi) need for cooperation with the EU in" exact="migration" post="policies and border control. For each dimension, a dual"/>
  <result pre="cooperation with the EU and among other MS on both" exact="migration" post="and asylum issues and border management was addressed within"/>
  <result pre="to migration-security nexus since there is a heterogeneous presence of" exact="migration" post="issues in national security and defence strategies. The common"/>
  <result pre="Irish, Slovenian, Spanish and British documents are the ones conceptualizing" exact="migration" post="issues autonomously instead of just linking them with other"/>
  <result pre="and Poland. So, we may conclude that the securitization of" exact="migration" post="is very much the securitization of immigration and is"/>
  <result pre="the nation-state and its population than securing the (im)migrants. Though" exact="migration" post="is recognized as a transnational phenomenon that requires cooperation,"/>
