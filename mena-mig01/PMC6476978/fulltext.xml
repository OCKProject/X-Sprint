Diverse mechanisms are thought to be related to the antiviral immune response of rainbow trout RBCs to VHSV. However, the specific rainbow trout RBC proteins that interact directly with VHSV are still unknown. In an attempt to identify VHSV-RBC protein interactions, we characterized the immunoprecipitated (IP) proteome of RBCs exposed to VHSV using an antibody against the N protein of VHSV. The IP proteomic characterization identified 31 proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. Among them, we identified interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5), a protein belonging to a family of proteins that are induced after the production of type I interferon. Importantly, IFIT5 has been implicated in the antiviral immune response. We confirmed the participation of IFIT5 in the rainbow trout RBC antiviral response by examining the expression profile of IFIT5 in RBCs after VHSV exposure at transcriptional and protein levels. We detected a correlation between the highest IFIT5 expression levels and the decline in VHSV replication at 6 h post-exposure. In addition, silencing <italic>ifit5</italic> resulted in a significant increase in VHSV replication in RBCs. Moreover, an increase in VHSV replication was observed in RBCs when the IFIT5 RNA-binding pocket cavity was modulated by using a natural compound from the SuperNatural II database. We performed a proximity ligation assay and detected a significant increase in positive cells among VHSV-exposed RBCs compared to unexposed RBCs, indicating protein-protein colocalization between IFIT5 and the glycoprotein G of VHSV. In summary, these results suggest a possible role of IFIT5 in the antiviral response of RBCs against VHSV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rainbow trout</kwd><kwd>IFIT5</kwd><kwd>red blood cells</kwd><kwd>erythrocyte</kwd><kwd>VHSV</kwd><kwd>antiviral immune response</kwd><kwd>immunoprecipitate</kwd><kwd>proteomic</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">European Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000781</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">GA639249</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="69"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="11376"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The role of nucleated red blood cells (RBCs) as immune response cell mediators has become clearer in recent years. Fish RBCs are the most common cell type in the blood and are best known for their functions in gas exchange and respiration. In mammals, mature RBCs are oval, biconcave cells that lack nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In non-mammalian vertebrates, RBCs are oval, flattened, biconvex disks with a nucleus and organelles in their cytoplasm (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), allowing them to <italic>de novo</italic> synthesize molecules in response to stimuli. Indeed, a set of biological processes related to antiviral immunity has been described in nucleated RBCs (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that RBCs halt viral hemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus (VHSV) infection (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The virus enters the cell, but does not replicate at levels comparable to piscine orthoreovirus or infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) infections in salmon RBCs (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Several mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in the antiviral response of rainbow trout RBCs to VHSV, such as increased protein levels of &#x003b2;-defensin 1 (BD1, an antimicrobial peptide involved in antiviral innate immunity), global protein synthesis inhibition corresponding to a virus and host cell shut-off, or an antioxidant-related antiviral response (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Further, an increase in the expression of IFN-related genes and proteins, such as Mx, has been observed in infectious pancreatic necrosis virus-exposed RBCs, where the viral infection was also non-productive (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) are a family of proteins that are strongly induced after the production of type I interferon (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The IFIT family is conserved in mammals, amphibians, birds, and bony fishes, but is not present in yeast, plants, or invertebrates (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). IFIT genes have been identified for many mammal species, as well as for various birds, reptiles, amphibians, and bony fishes. The number of IFIT genes and the composition of the family varies greatly between species (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Knowledge of IFIT genes is scarce in teleost species compared to humans. Recently, the complete repertoire of IFIT genes was described in zebrafish (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). IFIT proteins contain repeats of tetratricopeptide (TPR domains) and mediate a wide variety of protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions involved in the initiation of translation, virus replication, double-stranded RNA signaling, cell migration, and proliferation (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The multiple TPR domains may allow IFIT proteins to participate in the regulation of viral gene transcription and translation and in the negative regulation of the host inflammatory and antiviral response (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that members of the IFIT family selectively restrict viral replication by recognition of viral mRNA via binding of 2'-O methylated RNA or 5'-triphosphate RNA (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Other studies have found that members of the IFIT family decreased host cap-dependent protein translation by binding to the subunits of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) translation complex (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Studies conducted using double hybrid technique (Y2H) also suggested that IFIT proteins could bind to other viral proteins. For example, IFIT1 has been described to bind E1, a viral helicase of human papilloma virus (HPV) required for replication, sequestering it within the cytoplasm and preventing viral replication in the nucleus (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to elucidate the molecules responsible for halting VHSV replication inside rainbow trout RBCs, we characterized the RBC proteome that immunoprecipitates with the N protein of VHSV after RBC exposure to the virus. The IFIT5 protein was identified, and additional experiments confirmed the participation of IFIT5 in the rainbow trout RBC antiviral response. We determined the expression profile of IFIT5 in VHSV-exposed RBCs and detected a correlation between the highest IFIT5 expression level and diminished VHSV replication at 6 h post exposure (hpe) to VHSV. In addition, silencing <italic>ifit5</italic> resulted in a significant increase in VHSV replication in RBCs. IFIT5 modulation activity assays were performed by modulating the IFIT5 RNA-binding pocket cavity using a natural compound from the SuperNatural II (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) database identified through a molecular docking procedure. VHSV replication increased in VHSV-exposed RBCs when the IFIT5 RNA-binding pocket cavity was modulated by the compound. Moreover, a proximity ligation assay (PLA) was performed to investigate possible protein-protein colocalization between IFIT5 and the glycoprotein G of VHSV (GVHSV). A significant increase in positive cells was detected among VHSV-exposed RBCs compared with unexposed RBCs. Altogether, the results support a potential role of IFIT5 in the antiviral response of RBCs against VHSV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) &#x0003e;6 to 7 cm were obtained from Piszolla S.L., Cimballa Fish Farm, (Zaragoza, Spain) and maintained at the University Miguel Hernandez (UMH) facilities at 14&#x000b0;C.

The run was stopped as soon as the front was 1 cm into the resolving gel, so that the whole proteome was concentrated in the stacking/resolving gel interface. The unseparated protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining, excised, cut into 1 mm<sup>2</sup> cubes, deposited in 96 well plates, and processed automatically in a Proteineer DP (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The digestion protocol was based on Schevchenko et al.

Gel pieces were rinsed first with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and second with ACN and then were dried under a stream of nitrogen. Proteomics-grade Trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a final concentration of 16 ng/&#x003bc;L in 25% ACN/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution was added, and the digestion took place at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 h.

Injection volume was 5 &#x003bc;L. The LC system was coupled via a nanospray source to the mass spectrometer. Automatic data-dependent acquisition using dynamic exclusion allowed both full scans of (m/z 350-1,250) MS spectra and tandem MS CID spectra of the 15 most abundant ions. Acquisition time was 250 and 100 ms for MS and MSMS spectra, respectively. The candidate peptide was synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry in an Intavis Multiple peptide synthesizer (INTAVIS, Cologne, Germany).

First, antigenic propensity from different regions of the rainbow trout IFIT5 protein sequence (GenBank: <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="AAM18469.1">AAM18469.1</ext-link>) were identified, analyzing hydrophobicity (Hopp &#x00026; Woods test), accessibility, and flexibility. Then, peptides from the most antigenic regions were selected for peptide synthesis. Before synthesis, peptide sequences were modified by replacing cysteine residues with serine residues to avoid formation of intrachain disulfide bonds. Cysteine was added to the start and end of the peptide sequence to produce dimers. Peptide synthesis was performed using mesh packets with resin as previously described (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Peptide cleavage was performed using cold petroleum ether. After cleavage of the peptide from the resin, peptides were characterized by MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics Inc, Billerica, MA). Oxidation of peptides was performed by dilution of the peptide in miliQ water and agitating overnight. After oxidation, peptides were purified using G10 resin (Sigma-Aldrich) to eliminate salts.</p><p>To immunize mice against the peptides, 100 &#x003bc;g of oxidized peptide was conjugated with Freund's adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mix was subcutaneously injected into mice. A total of 3 injections were made with a lapse of 2 weeks between them. After all immunizations were done, euthanasia was carried out with anesthetic overdose. Blood was collected by cardiac injection. Blood sera were obtained by letting blood coagulate for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C followed by an incubation at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h. Finally, blood was centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, and serum was collected. An ELISA was performed to determine the serum titers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Wells were coated with 100 ng of the corresponding peptides diluted in 100 &#x003bc;L of PBS overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Blank wells were coated using only PBS. Then, PBS with peptides was removed and wells were washed 3 times with PBS. Then, 5% non-fat milk was used to block the wells at 37&#x000b0;C in agitation for 2 h. Sera were diluted in PBS (from 1/500 to 1/64,000) and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 90 min. Wells were further washed 3 times and incubated with goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibody diluted 1/7,000 for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C in agitation. Each well was incubated with 100 &#x003bc;L of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min.

Ficoll-purified RBCs were exposed to VHSV at MOI 1, and the expression levels of IFIT5 transcript and protein were evaluated at different time points by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry, respectively. VHSV replication in RBCs was evaluated at each time point by RT-qPCR using the N gene of VHSV. The <italic>ifit5</italic> gene transcripts started to increase by 3 hpe in RBCs, which correlated with the time point of the highest VHSV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). By 6 hpe, VHSV replication began to decrease, which coincided with the highest transcriptional and protein expression level of IFIT5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A&#x02013;D</xref>). After this time, IFIT5 transcripts and protein levels decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A,B</xref>), and <italic>ifit5</italic> transcripts reached the basal level at 72 hpe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Therefore, we searched for natural compounds that could bind to the IFIT5 RNA-binding pocket cavity and modulate its function. Natural compounds from the SuperNatural II database (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) were screened with a docking procedure. Starting from a library of 325,508 compounds, molecular docking experiments resulted in selection of compounds with a low Gibbs free energy variation value (&#x00394;G, kcal/mol), and then of potentially higher affinity. We used the 3D model of rainbow trout IFIT5 (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) to carry out the molecular docking experiments at the RNA-binding pocket cavity. Up to 20 poses per compound bound to the explored RNA-binding site cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) were achieved. Overall, 0.16% (<italic>n</italic> = 507) of compounds had a &#x00394;G &#x02264;-11.5 kcal/mol. Additional filters were applied until a reasonable number of candidate compounds were obtained. We analyzed 13 ADMET parameters for each compound, and only compounds with values within the limits of each parameter as described by Ruiz-Torres et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) passed through this screen. After ensuring commercial availability, 19 compounds were selected as candidates for IFIT5 modulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The molecular structures of these compounds were compared, resulting in different clusters with up to 70% identity. This strategy allowed us to choose at least one representative compound of each cluster to experimentally test for IFIT5 modulating activity. Ultimately, 3 compounds (SN00105976, SN00110204, and SN00130855) were selected for experimental testing.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>IFIT5 modulation increases VHSV replication. <bold>(A)</bold> Molecular docking analysis for the selected compound SN00105976 against IFIT5 RNA-binding pocket cavity.

We used these 2 compounds in additional assays to test their ability to modulate IFIT5 function.

To identify which rainbow trout RBC proteins interact directly with VHSV, we characterized the immunoprecipitated proteome of VHSV-exposed RBCs using an antibody against the N protein, which constitutes one of the major structural components of VHSV (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). The IP proteomic characterization included 31 proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. It should be taken into account that many of the proteins detected in the IP could have been immunoprecipitated due to a nucleation effect of protein-protein interactions in the protein milieu. However, an interactome network from the IP proteins revealed interesting functional associations, such as translation elongation, viral transcription, viral process, and immune system process. Similar cellular proteins have been found in dengue virus (DENV)-infected human hepatic cells (Huh-7) in a combined immunoprecipitation assay using anti-NS1 antibody from DENV and affinity chromatography assay (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Among them, they identified GAPDH, EEF1A1, histones, heat shock proteins, PRDX, tubulin, and ribosomal proteins. Ribosomal proteins were the most abundant proteins identified (50%) (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). In our study, 20% of identified proteins were ribosomal proteins. The main function of the ribosomal proteins is mRNA translation. However, several ribosomal proteins have other functions, such as regulatory functions in fundamental processes related to the cell cycle, apoptosis, development, and oncogenes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). It is well-known that viruses depend on ribosomes to synthesize proteins (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Several ribosomal genes or proteins have a significant association with virus. For example, the ribosomal protein RPL18 interacts with the DENV NS1 protein and is required during its replicative cycle (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). RPL18 and RPL7 have been also found in siRNA screens performed with yellow fever and West Nile virus (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). In addition, RPL6, RPL3, and RPL15 were significantly associated with viral acute respiratory infection in infants (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Moreover, RPS4X mRNA interacts with nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B) of hepatitis C virus (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Also, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) mRNA translation depends specifically on the 60S ribosomal protein RPL40 (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). We also found glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH, an important metabolic enzyme, which has been described to interact with some viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), cucumber mosaic virus (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>), DENV (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), bamboo mosaic virus (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), hepatitis A virus (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>), and human parainfluenza virus type 3 (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Therefore, GAPDH is important in some viral infections, but we do not know how GAPDH interacts with VHSV nor the biological significance of this interaction.</p><p>Several proteins related to the immune system were identified in the IP proteomic characterization. We identified the S100A9 protein, which has been recently classified as a novel damage-associated molecular pattern, and has been associated with hepatitis B virus infection (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), which interacts with BVDV Npro protein to decrease virus production (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). The involvement of S100A9 in rainbow trout RBC response to VHSV infection has not been studied and will be part of our future investigations. PRDX, or natural killer enhancing factor (NKEF), belongs to a family of antioxidant enzymes that has been described to protect against viral infection in fish (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). In VHSV-exposed RBCs, increased <italic>nkef</italic> transcripts were detected at 3 and 72 hpe (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, further studies are needed to determine the role of fish RBC NKEF in VHSV infection. This is part of our ongoing research.</p><p>Also related to the antiviral immune response, we identified the IFIT5 protein in the IP proteomic analysis. IFITs are a family of proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats induced after the production of type I interferon (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). These proteins have recently emerged as important players in antiviral innate immunity (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). IFIT genes have been identified for many species, including mammals and various birds, reptiles, amphibians, and bony fish (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Until now, a wide repertoire of mechanisms have proposed as to how IFIT proteins restrict viral replication (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Here, we showed a correlation between decreasing VHSV replication and the highest IFIT5 expression at 6 hpe in RBCs. However, in RTG-2 cells exposed to VHSV, there was no correlation with decreasing viral replication as occurs in RBCs despite upregulation of <italic>ifit5</italic> gene expression. This may be due to the high constitutive <italic>ifit5</italic> gene expression level that we found in RBCs compared with RTG-2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Some untreated RBCs showed intense cell staining with IFIT5 antibody in immunofluorescence experiments, which may also result from the high constitutive <italic>ifit5</italic> expression level in RBCs. Similar to IFIT5, another interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) protein such as Mx was reported to have a high basal expression level in RBCs (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, high IFIT5 basal levels could be implicated in the early disappearance of VHSV. IFIT5 expression was not affected by the reported decrease of type I IFN production after VHSV exposure (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, IFIT5 expression could be independent of IFN production, as has been described with Mx mRNA expression in rainbow trout injected with a plasmid encoding the chemokine CK5B (<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Proteomic sequencing of rainbow trout RBCs transfected with a plasmid encoding GVHSV revealed upregulation of antiviral mechanisms by ISG15. This was validated by the upregulation of <italic>mx, pkr</italic>, and <italic>ifit5</italic> gene expression, although <italic>ifn1</italic> gene expression appeared to be downregulated (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).</p><p><italic>ifit5</italic> silencing resulted in a significant increase in VHSV replication in RBCs. Similar results were found with the generation of a chicken IFIT5 knockout fibroblast cell line by using the genome editing technology CRISPR/Cas9. Infection of this fibroblast IFIT5-ko cell line with RNA viruses such as Newcastle disease virus and VSV substantially supported viral replication in both cases (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These results confirmed that IFIT5 is a crucial antiviral effector and that IFIT5 elimination weakens host barriers.</p><p>Mammalian IFIT5 also appears to have antiviral activity as an effector molecule by sequestration of viral RNA translation and through initiation of the innate immune response (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>).</p><p>Upregulation of immune genes, such as <italic>ifit5</italic>, in Atlantic salmon after an intramuscular injection of IFNc results in protection against ISAV infection (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Thus, it is possible that fish IFIT5, an ortholog of mammalian IFIT5 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), participates in antiviral mechanisms. The crystal structure of human IFIT5 shows a RNA-binding pocket cavity, which supports the antiviral mechanism of sequestering viral RNA and dampening translation (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This mechanism is used by IFIT proteins to bind viral mRNA and subsequently restrict viral replication (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Here we show that modulating IFIT5 activity in rainbow trout RBCs, by using a chemical compound obtained by <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking or with VHSV RNA, resulted in increased VHSV replication. These results indicated that rainbow trout IFIT5 may mediate antiviral activity in RBCs by binding viral RNA to the IFIT5 RNA-binding pocket cavity, thereby decreasing viral replication. This represents the first report of a fish IFIT5 antiviral mechanism. Similarly, chicken IFIT5 was recently described to specifically antagonize RNA viruses via this mechanism (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>IFIT5 can also positively regulate innate immune responses in humans (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>): ectopic expression of human IFIT5 upregulated the gene expression of IFN regulatory factor 3 (<italic>irf3</italic>) and nuclear factor-kB (<italic>nf</italic>&#x003ba;&#x003b2;), whereas knockdown of IFIT5 impaired the transcription of these genes (<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). Nevertheless, non-significant differences were observed in the gene expression of Mx, IFN&#x003b2;, viperin, interferon-induced 35 kDa (IFI35), and Arf-GAP with dual PH domain-containing protein 2 (ADAP2) proteins between transgenic and non-transgenic chicken that constitutively and stably expressed IFIT5 (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). However, previous studies of VHSV-exposed RBCs have shown downregulation of IFN1 protein and basal levels of Mx protein but upregulation of the cytokines interleukin 1 &#x003b2; (IL1&#x003b2;) and IL8, which are known to be activated by the transcription factor NF&#x003ba;&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, an increase in these cytokines could be related to the NF&#x003ba;&#x003b2; positive regulation by IFIT5. The role of rainbow trout IFIT5 in the activation of innate immune signaling pathways in RBCs needs to be further studied and is part of our ongoing research.</p><p>IFIT proteins can bind to viral proteins; for example, IFIT1 can bind to E1, a viral helicase of HPV, preventing viral replication in the nucleus (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, to our knowledge it has not been reported whether IFIT5 can interact directly with viral proteins. To this end, we investigated whether IFIT5 interacted with VHSV using a PLA. GVHSV protein was selected because it is the major virion surface protein and hence could increase the possibility of interaction with IFIT5. We found a significant increase in IFIT5-GVHSV colocalization-positive cells in VHSV-exposed RBCs compared to unexposed RBCs. More studies are needed to confirm an interaction between GVHSV and IFIT5, but it is clear that IFIT5 and VHSV are close enough to colocalize in the PLA.</p><p>In summary, we identified host proteins in rainbow trout RBCs that immunoprecipitated with VHSV. We focused on IFIT5 because it has recently emerged as an important player in antiviral innate immunity. We described a new defense mechanism based on IFIT5 antiviral activity in nucleated RBCs that appeared to contribute to halting the VHSV infection. This finding sheds light into novel antiviral therapeutics to mitigate the economic losses and social impact caused by viral infections in the aquaculture industry. This work broadens the knowledge of fish nucleated RBCs functions and their role in the immune response to viral infections.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Experimental protocols and methods relating to experimental animals were reviewed and approved by the Animal Welfare Body and the Research Ethics Committee at the University Miguel Hern&#x000e1;ndez (approval number 2014.205.E.OEP; 2016.221.E.OEP) and by the competent authority of the Regional Ministry of Presidency and Agriculture, Fisheries, Food and Water supply (approval number 2014/VSC/PEA/00205).
