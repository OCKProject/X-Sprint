Systematic analysis of AS signature in glioblastoma (GBM) is lacking and is greatly needed. We profiled genome-wide AS events in 498 GBM patients in TCGA using RNA-seq data, and splicing network and prognostic predictor were built by integrated bioinformatics analysis. Among 45,610 AS events in 10,434 genes, we detected 1,829 AS events in 1,311 genes, and 1,667 AS events in 1,146 genes that were significantly associated with overall survival and disease-free survival of GBM patients, respectively. Five potential feature genes, S100A4, ECE2, CAST, ASPH, and LY6K, were discovered after network mining as well as correlation analysis between AS and gene expression, most of which were related to carcinogenesis and development. Multivariate survival model analysis indicated that these five feature genes could classify the prognosis at AS event and gene expression level. This report opens up a new avenue for exploration of the pathogenesis of GBM through AS, thus more precisely guiding clinical treatment and prognosis judgment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alternative splicing (AS) events</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma (GBM)</kwd><kwd>overall survival</kwd><kwd>disease-free survival</kwd><kwd>prognostic predictor</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="44"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="6410"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Highlights</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>- Alternative splicing (AS) events may act as prognosis predicting factors for GBM</p></list-item><list-item><p>- S100A4, ECE2, CAST, ASPH, and LY6K were correlated between AS and gene expression</p></list-item><list-item><p>- A survival model with five feature genes efficiently classified GBM prognosis</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumors derived from the neural epithelium, generally called gliomas, account for 40&#x02013;50% of brain tumors, and are the most commonly observed intracranial malignant tumors (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Glioblastoma (GBM) is a rapidly growing glioma that develops from the healthy neuroglial cells that support the nerve cells in the brain (including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). As a devastating brain cancer, GBM is the most invasive glioma, which can rapidly grow and generally diffuse to adjacent brain tissues. Inability to detect GBM at an early stage and its post-operative recurrence are largely responsible for these low survival rates (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Currently, there are no reliable methods for detecting early-stage GBM and evaluating prognosis for GBM patients.</p><p>Cancer is, in many ways, a genetic disease and recent studies have focused on differences in molecular profiling of gene expression patterns to uncover diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as novel therapeutic targets (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, these studies, although with promising results, focus on alterations mainly at the gene expression level while transcript architecture regulated by alternative splicing (AS) is ignored.</p><p>High-throughput sequencing studies showed that more than 90% of human genes are subjected to AS (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). AS of pre-mRNA is a universal mechanism to generate mRNA isomers using a limited set of genes. AS is a process in which the introns of a majority of human multi-exon genes are deleted, and specific exons are alternatively included or excluded (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Apart from protein diversity, the mRNA isomer translation level can also be down-regulated by introducing AS, leading to the degradation of the early termination codon (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Aberrant AS is implicated in a variety of diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancers (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Cancer-specific alterations in splice site selection affect genes controlling cellular proliferation (e.g., CD44, Cyclin D1, HER2, and H-Ras), invasion (e.g., CD44, Ron, and MENA), angiogenesis (e.g., VEGF), apoptosis (e.g., Fas, Bcl-x, and caspase-2), and multi-drug resistance (e.g., MRP-1 and p53) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Therefore, AS provides a critical and flexible layer of regulation on many biological processes, and profiling of AS signature may provide potential biomarkers for cancer.</p><p>Since 1997, increasing number of studies have suggested associations between AS events and patient survival in GBM (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, systematic survival analyses of AS in GBM have not been reported yet and are urgently required. Here, we use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA sequencing data to gather key genes that affect the prognosis of GBM based on genome AS event analysis and to classify GBM samples into high and low risks using the prognosis model constructed according to gene expression profiles and AS events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Alternative Splicing Event Curation From TCGA RNA-seq Data</title><p>RNA sequencing data of TCGA GBM cohort were downloaded from TCGA data portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/">https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/</ext-link>). The RNA-Seq expression profile Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) dataset was downloaded and further converted into Transcripts Per Million (TPM) data; at the same time, the ID was transformed using the genome file of GENCODE (GRCh38.p2), and the protein encoding genes were obtained (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). To generate the AS profiles for each patient, SpliceSeq, a <italic>java</italic> application that unambiguously quantifies the inclusion level of each exon and splice junction (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), was used to evaluate the mRNA splicing patterns for patients in the GBM cohort. A total of 153 common samples in both TCGA SpliceSeq and RNA-Seq were enrolled in this study, and a total of 19,754 genes with expression values were obtained as the total gene set in this study. The Percent Spliced In (PSI) value, rating from zero to one and commonly used to quantify AS events (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), was calculated for seven types of AS events: Exon Skip (ES), Mutually Exclusive Exons (ME), Retained Intron (RI), Alternate Promoter (AP), Alternate Terminator (AT), Alternate Donor site (AD), and Alternate Acceptor site (AA).</p></sec><sec><title>Survival Analysis</title><p>A total of 597 GBM patients with at least 30 days of overall survival (OS) were included in this study.

A total of 45,610 AS events form 10,434 genes were detected, indicating that one gene might have almost four AS events on average.

When selecting <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, a total of 1,829 alternative splicing (AS) events involving 1,311 genes that were remarkably correlated with overall survival (OS) were obtained. Additionally, 1,667 AS events, covering 1,146 genes that were markedly correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) were acquired, as displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Besides, there were 123 intersections between AS events that were significantly correlated with OS and DFS, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. Among them, there were 96 intersected genes among all the involved genes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>, suggesting that there was consistency between genes involved in OS and DFS, to a certain extent. Most of these 96 genes were significantly associated with malignant progression and prognosis of GBM patients, including DKK3, NOTCH2NL, and HDAC9. We counted the AS events that were markedly correlated with OS and found that only the frequency of AP events (4.72%; 410/8,686) exceeded 4.01% (1,829/45,610), and that of the remaining events was under 4.01% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, among the AS events related to DFS, the frequency of AT events (4.85%; 410/8,456) and AP events (3.95; 341/8,686) exceeded the average level of 3.65% (1,667/45,610) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, these results suggested that there might be more AP and AT events associated with prognosis compared to ES events.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Overview of prognosis-related alternative splicing events in GBM. <bold>(A)</bold> Venn diagram of AS events of genes significantly related to overall survival and those related to recurrence after radio- and chemo-therapy. <bold>(B)</bold> Venn diagram of gene intersections in AS events of genes significantly related to overall survival and those related to recurrence after radio- and chemo-therapy. <bold>(C)</bold> Histogram of the 7 types of AS events that were markedly correlated with overall survival in the gene AS events. <bold>(D)</bold> Histogram of the 7 types of AS events that were remarkably correlated with recurrence after radio- and chemo-therapy for gene AS events.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fonc-09-00928-g0002"/></fig><p>We noticed that one gene might have two or more events that were significantly associated with patient survival.

Interestingly, one gene might have up to three types of AS events that were significantly associated with patient survival. For example, AP, AD, and AA events in the DLGAP1 gene were significantly associated with OS in the GBM cohort, while ES, RI, and AA events in the <italic>NBPF11</italic> gene were significantly associated with DFS in the GBM cohort.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene Interaction Network in Seven Types of Prognosis-Associated Alternative Splicing Events</title><p>To observe gene associations among different types of AS events that were apparently correlated with survival, the genes were mapped to the String database, and gene interactions were obtained using a score of &#x0003e;0.4 and visualized by Cytoscope. Cytoscape analysis of gene network revealed important cancer pathways including hub genes at NFGR, MAPK3, and SMAD7 for OS, and hub genes at FOXP1, MAP2K5, FGFR1, and NOTCH2 for DFS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To observe gene function in various types of AS events that were significantly correlated with survival, the AS genes in each AS event type that were significantly correlated with survival were also analyzed by KEGG enrichment. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM7">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>, from which it can be seen that these genes were enriched in multiple disease-related pathways, suggesting that these genes are involved in numerous biological functions. For example, KEGG enrichment of genes in RI events significantly correlated with OS, showing that these genes are involved in base excision repair. Moreover, KEGG enrichment of genes in AS events significantly correlated with DFS, indicating that the genes in ME events are involved in basal transcription factors, viral carcinogenesis, and nucleotide excision repair and that genes in AA events are involved in citrate cycle. These results indicated that the genes in AS events were mainly enriched in DNA damage repair because the mechanism of radio- and chemo-therapy for GBM patients involves damage to tumor DNA, leading to apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the Prognosis Factors of GBM Alternative Splicing Events</title><p>For each AS event, GBM patients were divided into two groups based on the PSI value (median cut).

On the other hand, more neural and proneural GBM were found in the low risk subgroup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Moreover, these two subgroups were significantly related to some molecular genetic features, particularly in TP53 and IDH1 mutant statuses, and 1p/19q co-deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). The high-risk subgroup (62%) exhibited more p53 mutations than did the low-risk subgroup (9.7%). Moreover, the high-risk subgroup (88%) contained the largest proportion of wild-type IDH1. 1p/19q co-deletion was higher in the high-risk subgroup (71%) than in the low-risk subgroup (43%). Thus, the two risk subgroups based on AS event and expression profile may reflect changes in some molecular genetic features, and these results also indicated that these five genes might serve as prognostic markers of GBM.</p><p>Based on the final prognostic predictor, 12 clinical GBM specimens were divided into low-risk (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and high-risk (<italic>n</italic> = 7) groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">Supplementary Figures 6A,B</xref>). The results of colony formation assays showed that the inhibitory effect of radiotherapy (6 Gy) and temozolomide (200 &#x003bc;M) on high-risk GBM specimen-derived cells was weaker than that on low-risk GBM specimen-derived cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">Supplementary Figures 6A&#x02013;C</xref>). Consistent with these, there was an inverse correlation between the risk level and OS (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0499), with AUC of 0.8750 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">Supplementary Figures 6D,E</xref>). Consistent with these, the risk level displayed a positive correlation with migration ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">Supplementary Figure 6F</xref>), neurosphere formation ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">Supplementary Figure 6G</xref>), and the expression levels of stemness markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM10">Supplementary Figures 6H,I</xref>) of GBM cells derived from these 12 GBM patients. Taken together, this prognostic predictor showed great promise in application in clinical practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>Aberrant pre-mRNA AS has been widely established as a novel contributor to cancer development (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Although a number of cancer-specific mRNA isoforms have been identified, there is a lack of understanding of AS event profiles and their functional pathways. With the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics methods, a more comprehensive overview of AS in GBM can be obtained. Published genome-wide studies on AS in GBM mainly focus on identifying &#x0201c;cancer-specific&#x0201d; AS events by comparing cancer tissues with normal controls. Here, we mainly performed a systematic identification and analysis of prognosis-associated AS events in 498 GBM patients in TCGA. Moreover, combined survival and correlation network analysis between AS events and their expression profiles offered an approach to address the underlying mechanism of AS events involved in patient prognosis. Finally, we showed that prognosis-associated AS events and their expression could be used to construct prognostic predictors with high performance for risk stratification in GBM; these predictors showed promise for application in clinical practice.</p><p>Diverse splicing patterns in one gene lead to a variety of isoforms, which makes AS and its regulation mechanism more complex in cancer (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). In this study, AS signatures in 498 GBM patients were profiled followed by integrated survival analyses with powerful prognosis predictors being built. A total of 45,610 AS events of 10,434 genes were detected. In addition, GBM generates the largest number of ESs and smallest number of MEs. The 10 most significant genes among the AS types were selected for multivariate regression model analysis to observe their ability to classify prognosis. The prediction model built with ES events showed the highest efficiency in distinguishing good or poor outcome of GBM patients among all the seven types.</p><p>The AS genes that evidently correlated with prognosis in each type were analyzed by KEGG enrichment analysis, revealing important cancer pathways, such as RI of base excision repair for patient survival; ME of viral carcinogenesis, basal transcription factors, nucleotide excision repair, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis; and AA of TCA cycle for tumor recurrence. Further investigations into how alternative splicing modulates these procedures are required in the future.</p><p>The TCGA RNA-Seq expression profile data were used for univariate survival analysis of each gene to observe the relationships between gene expression and prognosis in AS events that were markedly correlated with prognosis. Furthermore, the influence of expression profiles of genes subjected to AS events on prognosis was also examined. Five potential feature genes, including S100A4, ECE2, CAST, ASPH, and LY6K, were discovered after network mining as well as correlation analysis between alternative splicing and gene expression. A majority of these genes were related to cancer onset and development. For example, S100A4, an important member of S100 family proteins, functions to increase tumor progression and metastasis through TGF&#x003b2;/Smad, NFkB, and Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathways (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Aspartate-&#x003b2;-hydroxylase (ASPH) is expressed at high levels in several malignant neoplasms of distinct histogenesis, and at very low levels or not at all in most normal cells and tissues. GBM was associated with the highest levels of ASPH, more abundantly distributed in hypoxic than in normoxic tumor regions (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Multivariate survival model analysis indicated that these five feature genes could efficiently classify prognosis at AS event and gene expression levels. Indeed, the results of 12 clinical GBM specimens also confirmed that this prognostic predictor has great promise in clinical applications. The GBM cells derived from GBM patients at the high risk level exhibited more malignant behavior than did those derived at the low risk level. However, there was a lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> models of GBM involving the five AS-related genes to further demonstrate the application prospects of the final prognosis prediction. The further study will focus on the change of AS event and expression level of these five AS-related genes before or after post-radiation and TMZ combination treatment.</p><p>Given the high prevalence of splicing defects in cancer, small molecule modulators of RNA processing represent a potentially promising novel therapeutic strategy in cancer treatment. A recent review summarized that there were a number of small molecule modulators, including the earliest FR901464, showing promising effects in cancer therapy (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Knockdown of S100A4 may be a valuable therapeutic target because there is a positive correlation between AS events and its expression level. Although AS events of the genes ECE2, CAST, ASPH, and LY6K were negatively correlated with their expression, they would also offer more therapeutic strategies. For example, alternative terminator (AT) is the main type of AS event in the gene, ASPH, in GBM and might result in the upregulation of Humbug's transcriptome levels. Both dysfunction of splicing factor and knockdown of the truncated isoform of ASPH, Humbug, may be potential therapeutic strategies. Thus, our study also provided a number of potential targets for GBM therapy.</p><p>In summary, we reported that prognosis-associated AS events were ideal for prognostic predictor construction, and our final model performed well in risk stratification for GBM patients. A series of cancer-specific and prognosis-associated AS events were identified to provide potential therapeutic targets for GBM. Interaction network and functional connections were also constructed, which would enrich our understanding of the role of RNA alternative splicing in the tumorigenesis of GBM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Animal Use and Care Committees at Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, CAS.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>XC and ZF conceived and designed the experiments.
