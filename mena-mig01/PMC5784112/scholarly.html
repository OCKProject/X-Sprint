Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Although platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is used as a source of growth factors in regenerative medicine, its effectiveness remains controversial, partially due to the absence of PRP preparation protocols based on the regenerative role of platelets. Here, we aimed to optimise the protocol by analysing PRP angiogenic and regenerative properties. Three optimising strategies were evaluated: dilution, 4 °C pre-incubation, and plasma cryoprecipitate supplementation. Following coagulation, PRP releasates (PRPr) were used to induce angiogenesis <i>in vitro</i> (HMEC-1 proliferation, migration, and tubule formation) and <i>in vivo</i> (chorioallantoic membrane), as well as regeneration of excisional wounds on mouse skin. Washed platelet releasates induced greater angiogenesis than PRPr due to the anti-angiogenic effect of plasma, which was decreased by diluting PRPr with saline. Angiogenesis was also improved by both PRP pre-incubation at 4 °C and cryoprecipitate supplementation. A combination of optimising variables exerted an additive effect, thereby increasing the angiogenic activity of PRPr from healthy donors and diabetic patients. Optimised PRPr induced faster and more efficient mouse skin wound repair compared to that induced by non-optimised PRPr. Acetylsalicylic acid inhibited angiogenesis and tissue regeneration mediated by PRPr; this inhibition was reversed following optimisation. Our findings indicate that PRP pre-incubation at 4 °C, PRPr dilution, and cryoprecipitate supplementation improve the angiogenic and regenerative properties of PRP compared to the obtained by current methods.</p> </div> <div class="custom-meta-group" title="custom-meta-group"> <meta name="issue-copyright-statement" value="© The Author(s) 2018" /> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <div class="introduction" title="introduction"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p id="Par2">Wound repair is a dynamic and physiological process for regenerating damaged tissues<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>. Physiological wound healing may be disrupted by local factors (foreign bodies at the wound site, tissue maceration, ischaemia, or infection) or intrinsic individual factors (age, inflammatory diseases, drugs, or malnutrition) resulting in several clinical complications, including abnormal scarring, pain, pruritus, malignant transformation (Marjolin’s ulcer), haemorrhage, ulcer, infection, and amputation. These complications affect morbidity and mortality rates; hence, the healing of wounds is a current medical challenge<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup>. Currently there are several techniques to promote wound repair, including biological tissue replacement, gene therapy, recombinant growth factors, and cell-based treatments<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a>,<a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>. Additionally, there are local methods for improving blood circulation in patients with chronic wounds associated with neuropathies and vascular diseases. These techniques include mechanical/physical methods (negative pressure therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression injuries) and ionic methods (hyperbaric treatment with ozone)<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par3">Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) constitutes an alternative therapy to promote tissue regeneration mediated by the release of several growth factors and cytokines stored in the alpha granules of platelets. These molecules modulate angiogenesis, remodel the extracellular matrix and affect the recruitment, proliferation, and differentiation of stem cells<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a>,<a href="#CR6">6</a></sup>. In contrast with other regenerative therapies, generating PRP is an economical method and does not require complex equipment or training. In addition, due to its primarily autologous origin and relatively non-invasive collection technique, the risks of infection or immune rejection associated with PRP are minimised<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a>,<a href="#CR6">6</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par4">PRP is used in regenerative medicine for treating several clinical conditions, including ulcers, burns, muscle damage, and bone diseases and in tissue recovery after surgery. Despite the large variability of applications, the efficacy of regenerative treatments using PRP has been called into question due to the absence of large controlled clinical trials and consensus regarding PRP preparation techniques. The procedures currently used are derived from classical protocols for obtaining platelet concentrates for transfusion, coagulation assays or platelet functionality, which are focused on preserving platelet haemostatic but not regenerative responses. Thus, in this study, we aimed to optimise the protocol for PRP preparation, attempting to maximise the healing properties of platelets and analysing the effects on angiogenic and tissue regenerative responses.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="results"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Plasma inhibits angiogenesis mediated by platelet-derived growth factors</div> <p id="Par5">It is well-known that platelet-derived growth factors promote angiogenesis, a crucial initial step for tissue regeneration mediated by PRP. However, our previous findings regarding the release of pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules following activation of thrombin receptors (PAR-1 or PAR-4) suggested that plasma interferes with the pro-angiogenic role of platelets<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. Surprisingly, a possible contribution of the high levels of physiological anti-angiogenic molecules present in plasma<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a>,<a href="#CR8">8</a></sup> has not been considered in the context of PRP in tissue regeneration. To evaluate whether plasma interferes with the pro-angiogenic role of platelets, we first compared angiogenesis induced by platelets in the presence or absence of plasma. For these experiments, releasates obtained following PRP coagulation (PRPr) or plasma-free activated platelets (washed platelets, WPr) were used to induce endothelial proliferation, migration, and tubule formation in a human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). Although the platelet concentration in WP and PRP was similar (450 ± 51 × 10<sup>9</sup> and 453 ± 57 × 10<sup>9</sup> platelets/L, respectively), endothelial proliferation induced by WPr was significantly higher (P &amp;lt; 0.01) than that induced by PRPr (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1A</a>). Furthermore, when endothelial proliferation was induced by WPr in the presence of increasing amounts of plasma, HMEC-1 proliferation was proportionally inhibited by the increasing plasma concentration (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1B</a>). This phenomenon was not associated with a cytotoxic effect because necrotic or apoptotic cells never exceeded 1% in any of the plasma treatments (data not shown). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1</span></a></div>   <p>Plasma inhibits angiogenesis mediated by platelets. (<b>A</b>) HMEC-1 (15 × 10<sup>3</sup>) were incubated with saline plus FBS 2% (control), PRPr or WPr; (<b>B</b>) WPr supplemented with increasing % of plasma; or (<b>C</b>) PRPr diluted with saline, and endothelial cell proliferation was determined after 24 h by acid phosphatase activity assay. (<b>D,E</b>) Migration into scratched monolayers of endothelial cells and (<b>F,G</b>) tubule formation in Matrigel-coated wells was induced, as indicated, with WPr and PRPr (diluted or not). Images are representative of four to seven independent experiments (magnification 40X, scale bars: 200 μm).

As shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1C</a>, dilution improved the ability of PRPr to induce HMEC-1 growth, with a maximum peak at 25% PRPr; at higher dilutions, the effect decreased until it was completely lost at 6% PRPr. Similar results were obtained for HMEC-1 migration (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1D,E</a>) and tubule formation (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1F,G</a>). Therefore, the concentration of 25% PRPr was selected for further experimentation.</p> </div> <div class="coldpreconditioning,plasmacryoprecipitatesupplementation,anddilutionenhanceangiogenesismediatedbyprpr" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Cold preconditioning, plasma cryoprecipitate supplementation, and dilution enhance angiogenesis mediated by PRPr</div> <p id="Par7">Although PRP is currently processed at 37 °C or room temperature (RT) (20–25 °C), it is well-known that low temperatures enhance platelet activation, improving the release of dense and alpha granules<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. Thus, we evaluated the effect of cold preconditioning on the release of platelet-derived growth factors. For this purpose, PRP was incubated at 37 °C, 23 °C, or 4 °C for 30 min before the generation of PRPr. Next, levels of several pro-angiogenic molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-8 were determined in PRPr and compared to the total amount of each protein in platelet lysates. As shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2A</a>, the secretion of VEGF, EGF, bFGF, IL-17, and IL-8, but not PDGF, was induced in a temperature-dependent manner. While VEGF, EGF, bFGF, IL-17, and IL-8 were partially released when PRP was incubated at 37 °C or 23 °C (20–60% of the total intra-platelet amount), total secretion of these molecules was only achieved when PRP was incubated at 4 °C, indicating that cold preconditioning maximises the release of platelet-derived pro-angiogenic molecules. In agreement with these results, proliferation of HMEC-1 triggered by PRPr obtained from PRP preconditioned at 4 °C was increased compared to that induced by PRP preconditioned at 37 °C (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2B</a>). In addition, we observed that phosphorylation of p38–a relevant process involved in granule secretion from platelets–was increased as a result of exposure of platelets to 4 °C (Suppl. Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1A</a>). Moreover, a complete reversion of the enhanced angiogenesis mediated by PRP cold preconditioning was observed when platelet p38 phosphorylation was blocked by the specific inhibitor, SB203580, indicating that cold preconditioning primes platelet degranulation by enhancing activation of p38-mediated signalling (Suppl. Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">1B</a>). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2</span></a></div>   <p>Cold preconditioning promotes the release of growth factors and cytokines from platelets. (<b>A</b>) PRP was incubated at 37 °C, 23 °C, or 4 °C for 30 min, and the levels of VEGF, EGF, bFGF, IL-17, IL-8, and PDGF in releasates of PRP before clotting (CaCl<sub>2</sub>−) or after clotting (CaCl<sub>2</sub>+) were determined by ELISA. Total intra-platelet levels were measured in platelet lysates. (<b>B</b>) PRP was incubated at 37 °C, 23 °C, or 4 °C for 30 min, clotted with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (22 mM) for 40 min, and releasates were used to induce HMEC-1 (15 × 10<sup>3</sup>) proliferation.

(<b>C</b>) HMEC-1 (15 × 10<sup>3</sup>) were incubated, individually or in combinations, with anti-human VEGFR2/KDR/Flk-1 (10 µg/ml), anti-human-EGFR (40 µg/ml) or irrelevant IgG, for 30 min. Next, endothelial proliferation was induced by addition of recombinant VEGF (20 ng/ml), EGF (20 ng/ml) or with PRPr preincubated at 37 °C or 4 °C and then clotting was induced with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (22 mM).

Our findings demonstrate that combined but not individual blockade of both molecules resulted in a moderate inhibition of endothelial proliferation (17% inhibition) in PRPr at 37 °C and 4 °C, without altering the ratio of angiogenesis observed at these temperatures (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2C</a>).</p> <p id="Par9">Interestingly, an additive effect was observed by the combination of 4 °C PRP preconditioning and PRPr dilution, with a significant improvement in HMEC-1 proliferation compared to that induced by non-optimised PRPr (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3A</a>). When the effect of temperature was analysed on HMEC-1 migration, no differences were observed between 37 °C and 4 °C. However, the effects of PRPr dilution were synergised with those of PRP pre-cooling at 4 °C, thereby significantly improving endothelial cell migration (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3B</a>).

Inhibition of PRP regenerative activity by ASA is partially compensated by optimisation</div> <p id="Par18">We and others have demonstrated that angiogenesis mediated by platelets is inhibited by ASA<sup><a href="#CR15">15</a>–<a href="#CR19">19</a></sup>. Considering the massive use of ASA as an anti-inflammatory drug (500–1500 mg/day) or as anti-aggregatory therapy for cardiovascular disorders (100 mg/day), it is surprising that, to date, there is no available information about a possible effect of this anti-platelet drug on the PRP regenerative capacity. Thus, we next evaluated the effect of ASA on PRP-mediated angiogenesis. PRP was pre-incubated with high (0.5 mM) or low (0.1 mM) doses of ASA for 30 min, following which PRPr and O-PRPr were generated and used to induce angiogenesis <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.</p> <p id="Par19">As shown in Fig. <a href="#Fig7">7</a>, all <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> angiogenic responses mediated by PRPr were completely dampened by pre-incubation with both low and high concentrations of ASA. Although it could be argued that the inhibition of angiogenesis was by the direct action of ASA on endothelial cells, this hypothesis was ruled out because the addition of PRPr that had been supplemented with 0.5 and 0.1 mM ASA after PRP coagulation failed to modify any of the <i>in vitro</i> angiogenic responses (Suppl. Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">2</a>), indicating that the inhibitory effect was exerted on platelets and not endothelial cells. However, higher ASA concentrations were required to inhibit angiogenesis (Suppl. Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">2</a>).

Moreover, as in the <i>in vitro</i> studies, we observed that compared to PRPr from non-ASA-treated mice, injection of PRPr obtained from ASA-treated mice (ASA-PRPr) failed to induce wound healing, and the addition of ASA-O-PRPr partially reversed the inhibitory effect of ASA (Fig. <a href="#Fig8">8</a>). Specifically, a significant improvement in wound closure was observed after 10 days of treatment with ASA-O-PRPr but not ASA-PRPr (Fig. <a href="#Fig8">8A</a>).

Discussion</div> <p id="Par21">Although PRP is used as a source of platelet-derived growth factors in regenerative medicine, its effectiveness remains controversial, partially due to the lack of large controlled clinical trials and the absence of PRP preparation protocols based on the regenerative role of platelets. Herein, we aimed to optimise current PRP preparation protocols by evaluating angiogenic and regenerative responses induced by PRP. Our results indicate that preincubation of PRP at 4 °C, PRPr dilution, and plasma cryoprecipitate supplementation improve the angiogenic and regenerative properties of PRP compared to those of the PRP obtained by current methods.</p> <p id="Par22">We observed that both WPr and diluted PRPr were more efficient than PRPr as inducers of <i>in vitro</i> angiogenic responses, such us endothelial proliferation, migration, and tubule formation. These results are in agreement with our previous findings demonstrating that angiogenic responses induced by releasates derived from PAR-1- or PAR-4-stimulated WP were higher than those mediated by PRP<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a></sup>. In addition, it was demonstrated that, while the proliferation of osteoblasts<sup><a href="#CR20">20</a></sup> or Schwann cells<sup><a href="#CR21">21</a></sup> is maximally induced by a basal medium supplemented with 20% PRPr, cell growth is inhibited at higher PRPr concentrations (&amp;gt;40%). It is known that compared to platelets, plasma contains higher levels of anti-angiogenic molecules<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a>,<a href="#CR8">8</a></sup>, including matrix-derived inhibitors (e.g., endostatin, thrombospondin, and tumstatin) as well as non-matrix derived inhibitors (e.g., angiostatin, the soluble version of VEGFR-1 (sFlt-1), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and prolactin) which may competitively and reversibly interfere with several growth factor receptors<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a></sup>. Therefore, it is conceivable that the removal of plasma accounts for the higher angiogenic activity of WP compared to that of PRP. Interestingly, we observed that, while PRPr dilution to 25% improved its ability to induce HMEC-1 growth, higher dilutions decreased the effect until it was completely lost at 6% PRPr. These data suggest that the optimal angiogenic activity achieved by PRPr dilution is the result of a balance between reduction of anti-angiogenic plasma molecules and maintenance of the minimal amount of platelet-derived growth factors required to induce angiogenesis. Indeed, it has been reported that the high-affinity interaction between angiogenic molecules and their receptors requires a low concentration of ligands<sup><a href="#CR22">22</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par23">Another strategy to improve angiogenesis mediated by PRP is to increase the amount of growth factors released from platelets. PRP is usually processed at 37 °C or RT (20–25 °C); however, it is traditionally known that lower temperatures prime platelet activation and trigger the release of alpha granules<sup><a href="#CR9">9</a></sup>. Accordingly, we observed that the release of VEGF, EGF, bFGF, IL-17, and IL-8, but not PDGF, was significantly increased when PRP was incubated at 4 °C before inducing coagulation. The intriguing observation that the release of PDGF was not modified by temperature may be explained by the new theories of platelet granule secretion which recognise the existence of alpha granule subtypes associated with variable morphologies, protein cargos, and release mechanisms<sup><a href="#CR23">23</a>–<a href="#CR25">25</a></sup>. Remarkably, suppressing the effects of molecules, such as EGF or VEGF, was not enough to reverse the enhanced angiogenesis induced by 4 °C preconditioning. In agreement with our previous reports<sup><a href="#CR15">15</a>,<a href="#CR26">26</a></sup>, these results indicate that angiogenesis mediated by platelets is a complex process, not associated with a particular growth factor, but with the combined activity of several proangiogenic molecules. Our data, demonstrating that phosphorylation of p38–an important signalling involved in granule secretion from platelets–was increased when platelets were exposed to 4 °C and that a complete reversion of cold preconditioning enhanced angiogenesis was observed in the presence of the specific inhibitor of p38 phosphorylation, indicated that cold preconditioning primes platelet-mediated angiogenesis by enhancing activation of p38.</p> <p id="Par24">Additionally, in agreement with previous findings regarding the effect of low temperature on coagulation<sup><a href="#CR27">27</a>,<a href="#CR28">28</a></sup>, we observed that the viscosity of PRP at 37 °C was quickly altered ~1 min after CaCl<sub>2</sub> addition, a phenomenon associated with the initiation of coagulation. In contrast, when PRP was pre-incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then incubated with calcium at 37 °C, the initiation of coagulation was markedly delayed by up to ~6 min (Suppl. Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">3</a>). These data suggest that apart from increasing angiogenesis, cold pre-incubation may also be beneficial for delaying PRP coagulation inside the syringe in protocols in which PRP is administered through injection immediately after the addition of calcium (e.g. intraarticular, intraosseous, or subcutaneous)<sup><a href="#CR29">29</a></sup>, thereby reducing pain associated with the injection of viscous solutions<sup><a href="#CR30">30</a>,<a href="#CR31">31</a></sup>. On the other hand, several controversies are associated with storage of platelets at 4 °C, since it may induce platelet activation as well as their rapid clearance from circulation<sup><a href="#CR32">32</a></sup>. However, considering that the application of PRP for tissue regeneration is local and not systemic, these concerns regarding the safety and quality control of refrigerated platelets may be unimportant in the clinical setting of regenerative medicine.</p> <p id="Par25">Supplementation with the cryoprecipitate obtained after slowly thawing fresh frozen plasma was also tested as an approach to enhance the pro-angiogenic effect of platelets. This biomaterial is used in regenerative treatments as a provisional matrix that offers a semi-solid scaffold for re-epithelisation and angiogenesis, two critical processes during tissue regeneration<sup><a href="#CR11">11</a>,<a href="#CR12">12</a></sup>. Our findings demonstrate that endothelial migration and tubule formation mediated by PRPr were enhanced following cryoprecipitate supplementation. This effect could be associated with the fact that the cryoprecipitate is rich in fibrinogen, fibronectin, and VWF, three adhesion molecules that bind to endothelial integrins and provide a scaffolding surface necessary for cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation<sup><a href="#CR10">10</a>,<a href="#CR11">11</a></sup>. In contrast to tubule formation and migration, the proliferation of endothelial cells was not modified by cryoprecipitate supplementation. The lack of mitogenic activity of the cryoprecipitate is not surprising, considering that intracellular signalling pathways governing migration and tubule formation, although possibly overlapping, are distinctly separated from those regulating proliferation<sup><a href="#CR33">33</a></sup>.</p> <p id="Par26">PRP is currently administered not only to healthy individuals (to improve tissue recovery after surgery, or muscle and bone repair after trauma) but also for healing injuries associated with inflammatory diseases (burns, diabetic foot ulcers, and rheumatoid arthritis)<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a></sup>. Intriguingly, the regenerative capacities of PRP derived from patients with inflammatory diseases remain uncertain. We observed that, like PRPr from healthy donors, angiogenesis triggered by PRPr from patients with T2DM–a metabolic disease with a component of low-grade chronic inflammation–was significantly improved following optimisation, suggesting that these protocols may also be considered for improving autologous treatment of chronic wounds in diabetic patients. Furthermore, under our experimental conditions, the angiogenic responses induced by PRPr from diabetic patients were greater than those triggered by PRPr from healthy donors. This phenomenon was not surprising, considering the high levels of growth factors constitutively circulating in the plasma of diabetic patients including EGF, FGF-2, G-CGF, TNFα, and VEGF<sup><a href="#CR34">34</a>,<a href="#CR35">35</a></sup>. Controversially, a recent study performed by Miao <i>et al</i>. demonstrated that releasates from PAR-1- or PAR-4-activated platelets from healthy or diabetic patients exert similar levels of endothelial tubular formation <i>in vitro</i><sup><a href="#CR36">36</a></sup>. Differences between the results presented by Miao and those of the current study may be associated with the fact that, while they used WP, we used PRP, adding a possible effect of plasma. Apart from the experimental differences, both studies suggest that the ability of platelets and/or PRP to modulate angiogenesis is preserved in diabetic patients, emphasising that the primary cause of diabetic chronic wounds is associated with severe neuropathy and vascular dysfunction<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a>,<a href="#CR13">13</a>,<a href="#CR14">14</a>,<a href="#CR34">34</a></sup> and not necessarily with impaired physiologic mechanisms involved in wound healing, such as angiogenesis.</p> <p id="Par27">Beyond angiogenesis, tissue regeneration also requires the maturation of other tissues as well as fibroblast migration and activation, extracellular cell matrix reorganisation, and cell-cell interactions<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>. Using a murine model of full-thickness skin wound healing, our findings demonstrate that similar to previous reports<sup><a href="#CR37">37</a>,<a href="#CR38">38</a></sup>, 7–14 days were required to induce wound closure and skin regeneration after traditional PRPr treatment. Remarkably, this phenomenon was accelerated to 3–10 days by treatment with O-PRPr. Unlike mice, full-excisional wound regeneration in humans is a more gradual and complex process that requires between months and years, depending on the wound characteristics<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup>. Bearing this in mind, the acceleration of wound healing by PRP optimisation in patients could represent a reduction in hospitalisation costs, a decrease in analgesic and anti-inflammatory indications, and may lower risks of non-healing complications including infection, lost limb functionality, and amputation<sup><a href="#CR39">39</a>,<a href="#CR40">40</a></sup>, that are commonly associated with impaired skin healing and regeneration in diabetic chronic wounds and dermal burns, which are target diseases for PRP treatment.</p> <p id="Par28">To date, there is no available information on the possible effects of anti-platelet drugs on the regenerative capacity of PRP. In this context, we studied the effect of ASA, a common anti-platelet drug used as therapy for several anti-inflammatory diseases and for the prevention of cardiovascular events. In agreement with previous reports,<sup><a href="#CR15">15</a>–<a href="#CR19">19</a></sup> our findings demonstrate that angiogenesis mediated by PRPr was completely abolished by the pre-treatment of PRP with ASA. This phenomenon was associated with inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-1 signalling pathway, which is crucial for granule secretion and the consequent release of platelet-derived growth factors, such as VEGF, EGF, bFGF, IL-17, and IL-8 (Suppl. Fig. <a href="#MOESM1">4</a>).</p> <p id="Par29">Beyond angiogenesis, mouse skin wound healing was also completely blocked by PRPr derived from ASA-treated mice, demonstrating for the first time that this anti-platelet drug negatively affects tissue regeneration mediated by PRP. Remarkably, and in contrast with traditional PRP, the inhibitory effect of ASA was partially reversed following PRP optimisation. Moreover, angiogenic responses including tubule formation (<i>in vitro</i>) and blood vessel development (<i>in vivo</i>), as well as mouse skin regeneration, were significantly induced after the infusion of ASA-O-PRPr.</p> <p id="Par30">In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that compared to non-optimised PRP (traditional method at 37 °C, without dilution or supplements), a combination of the three PRP optimising variables (PRP preincubation at 4 °C, PRPr diluted to 25% and supplemented with plasma cryoprecipitate) exerted an additive effect, resulting in a marked improvement in PRPr-mediated angiogenesis. These simple and economic variables induce more efficient tissue repair than that induced by PRP obtained by the current preparation methods for regenerative medicine, not only using PRP from healthy donors but also PRP obtained from diabetic patients. Moreover, the inhibitory effect that ASA exerts on regeneration mediated by PRP was reversed by optimisation, suggesting that this method may be useful for improving tissue regeneration in patients treated with ASA.</p> <p id="Par31">A controlled randomised clinical trial is warranted to confirm the usefulness of this protocol in the clinical setting.</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
