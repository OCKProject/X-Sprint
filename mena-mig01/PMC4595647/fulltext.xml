Although the pathogenesis is poorly understood, evidence suggests that genetic and epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may play a key role. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; (TGF-&#x003b2;) superfamily and are important regulators in IPF. Here we identified BMP endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) as a key regulator of fibroblast activation. BMPER is a secreted glycoprotein that binds directly to BMPs and may regulate TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling, but its role in lung fibrosis is not clear. BMPER is highly expressed in human IPF lung fibroblasts compared to normal lung fibroblasts. Demethylation agent 5&#x02032;-azacytidine decreased BMPER expression in fibroblasts, and attenuated the invasion and migration of IPF lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated reduction of BMPER in the human lung fibroblasts impaired cell migration and invasion. 5&#x02032;-azacytidine treatment additionally regulated BMPER expression and reduced lung fibrosis in mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings demonstrate that methylation of specific genes in fibroblasts may offer a new therapeutic strategy for IPF by modulating fibroblast activation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Progressive lung fibrosis is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide with limited therapeutic options.

BMPER is highly expressed in malignant tumors and controls invasive cell behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. Our previous studies showed that increased invasion and migration capacities of fibroblasts contribute to severe lung fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Inhibition of fibroblast migration can attenuate pulmonary fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. However, the role of BMPER in lung fibrosis has not been investigated. Interestingly, we found that the expression of several BMP binding proteins, including Gremlin1 and BMPER, was decreased in IPF fibroblasts after 5&#x02032;-azacytidine treatment. The expression of Gremlin is increased in IPF lungs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that methylation-mediated expression of BMPER might be involved in lung fibrogenesis. We found that BMPER was up regulated in lung tissue and fibroblasts from IPF patients. Demethylation with 5&#x02032;-azacytidine treatment resulted in decreased BMPER expression in primary lung fibroblasts, attenuated fibroblast activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and lung fibrosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, BMPER regulated lung fibrosis through TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Up-Regulation of BMPER in IPF lung fibroblasts and tissues</title><p>First we examined whether BMPER expression was aberrant between IPF and normal lung fibroblasts by Western blotting and qRT-PCR.

In order to define the epigenetic regulation of lung fibrotic fibroblasts, a gene array was used to compare the gene expression changed in human lung fibroblasts from IPF patients after demethylation with 5&#x02032;-azacytidine. It showed that after 5&#x02032;-azacytidine treatment, the expression of several BMP binding proteins such as Gremlin1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, thrombospondin 1, SPARC-like 1, and BMPER were decreased compared to that of control fibroblasts. To directly investigate if elevated BMPER expression in IPF fibroblasts is associated with DNA methylation, we treated fibroblasts from IPF and normal lungs with the demethylation agent 5&#x02032;-azacytidine. BMPER expression was decreased at both the protein and mRNA levels in the 5&#x02019;-azacytidine treated normal and IPF fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a&#x02013;e</xref>).</p><p>Next we wanted to determine if the regulation of BMPER expression by demethylation was under the transcriptional level.

To determine possible regulation of BMPER by demethylation, we generated the BMPER promoter construct containing &#x02212;465 to +1 to drive luciferase as a reporter. The BMPER promoter construct was transfected into HEK293 cells. The cells were treated with 5&#x02032;-azacytidine 24&#x02009;hours after transfection, and then harvested for luciferase activity measurement 48&#x02009;hours after transfection. Consistent with a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, we found that the proximal promoter (&#x02212;465 to +1) contained an activating regulatory element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2f</xref>).

To gain insight into the role of BMPER in the progression of lung fibrosis, we next investigated if and how 5&#x02032;-azacytidine treatment affects matrix production. After normal and IPF fibroblasts were treated with 5&#x02032;-azacytidine, western blotting analysis showed that Col1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a,b</xref>) and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c,d</xref>) were decreased in both normal and IPF lung fibroblasts.

HA ELISA confirmed that after 5&#x02032;-azacytidine treatment, the production of HA in the supernatant was decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>).

In general, Smad2/3 transmit TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, while BMPs signal through Smad1/5/8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. We hypothesized that BMPER may mediate TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling through Smad phosphorylation during demethylation. We therefore used siRNA interference (loss-of-function) and overexpression of BMPER (gain-of-function) in MRC5 cells to examine Smad-mediated TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling that occurs downstream of BMPER. When BMPER was knocked down with BMPER specific siRNA, BMPER expression was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). The phosphorylation levels of Smad3 were attenuated, whereas the phosphorylation levels of Smad1 were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref>). In contrast, the phosphorylation levels of Smad3 were increased and the phosphorylation levels of Smad1 were decreased in MRC5 cells with BMPER overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). These results show that BMPER can modulate TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling, in which BMPER may activate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and inhibit the BMP signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>BMPER regulates cell migration and invasion in fibroblasts</title><p>We next determined the functional role of BMPER in lung fibroblasts.

Therefore, BMPER was knocked down using BMPER-specific siRNA in MRC5 cells, primary normal and IPF lung fibroblasts. Downregulation of BMPER with specific siRNA markedly reduced cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a,b</xref>) and migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c,d</xref>). To investigate the potential mechanism of increased cell invasion and migration, we measured matrix production after knocking down BMPER.

First, BMPER mRNA and protein levels were highly expressed in IPF lung fibroblasts compared to normal lung fibroblasts. Second, down-regulation of BMPER caused a decrease in cell invasion and migration capacities in IPF lung fibroblasts. Third, BMPER expression correlated with the extracellular matrix production, since reduced expression of BMPER, either through demethylation or siRNA inhibition, was accompanied by a decrease of the matrix production. Our previous study showed that cell invasion is increased in IPF fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. Moreover, IPF lung fibroblasts have an increased migratory capacity compared to normal lung fibroblasts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. But the mechanism of fibroblast activation in IPF is not completely clear. We showed here that BMPER in IPF lung fibroblasts might be responsible for the activation of fibrotic fibroblasts. At the molecular level, we showed that BMPER regulates fibrosis through mediating TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling pathway, in which BMPER may activate TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and inhibit BMP signaling pathway. Both TGF-&#x003b2; and BMP4 have been shown to play roles in regulating tissue fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. For example, TGF-&#x003b2; is a key cytokine in the pathogenesis of IPF and its signaling components have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating tissue fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. And in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, TGF-&#x003b2; and BMP signaling followed an inverse course, with dynamic activation of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and repression of BMP signaling activity. Modulating the balance between BMP and TGF-&#x003b2; may be a therapeutic target in fibrotic lung disease<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>.</p><p>Epigenetic regulation has been shown to play a role in fibrogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>.

Treatment with 5&#x02032;-azacytidine in mice <italic>in vivo</italic> has been shown a global demethylation event<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. In this study, much lower dose of 5&#x02032;-azacytidine was used to minimize the cytotoxicity and retain its ability as a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation.</p><p>We further demonstrated that the demethylation agent 5&#x02032;-azacytidine regulated BMPER expression through the transcriptional level <italic>in vitro</italic> and attenuated lung fibrosis in mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. It is consistent with previous reports that epigenetic mechanisms control gene expression and are likely to regulate the IPF transcriptome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> experiment, we saw that global demethylation with 5&#x02032;-azacytidine decreased the expression of BMPER and extracellular matrix, but did not completely abrogate lung fibrosis following bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. We tried high-dose (10&#x02009;mg/kg) of 5&#x02032;-azacytidine in mouse models <italic>in vivo</italic> as in a previous report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and it caused severe cytotoxic effect in our experimental conditions. Thus, the use of low-dose may take advantage of the demethylating effects of the drug in the current study, allowing more frequent or long-term administrations while minimizing cytotoxic side effects. For the demethylating agents currently being used in mice in lung fibrosis models, the important issue that must be carefully evaluated is the ideal dose of the 5&#x02032;-azacytidine and the efficiency of the drug.</p><p>However, we also recognized that there are a few limitations with the current investigation. Although we showed that 5&#x02032;-azacytidine regulated BMPER promoter activity, more detailed analysis such as the promoter sequence requirement, the possible methylation/demethylation enzymes mediated methylation, and the methylation of BMPER promoter in IPF fibroblasts are needed. We showed that BMPER is upregulated in IPF lung fibroblasts, however the role of BMPER in alveolar type II cells was not investigated. The regulation of BMPER, and the role of BMPER in mediating TGF-&#x003b2;/BMP signaling may differ in alveolar type II cells compared to lung fibroblasts. We recently showed that Fstl1 promoted TGF-&#x003b2; signaling and inhibits BMP signaling in epithelial cells, whereas in fibroblasts Fstl1 promotes TGF-&#x003b2; signaling without altering BMP signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Additional studies are required to gain the mechanisms that cause BMPER promoter be methylated and whether BMPER promoter only is sufficient to induce lung fibrosis.
