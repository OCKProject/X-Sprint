    "BACKGROUND: With the evolution of body contouring, few innovative alternatives have been developed for cosmetic treatment in the hip area. METHODS: A multicenter controlled study was conducted, including a prior review of the literature regarding the hip area. Dissections were performed on 4 male cadavers, outlining the \"musculoaponeurotic area of the hip.\" The area was subdivided into anterior and posterior surfaces. A clinical study was conducted in 79 patients, obtaining a scale by using the most prominent points on the sides of both thighs as the main reference. With the lines marked on photographs and the measurements, a \"clinicophotographic scaling system\" was designed. RESULTS: The anterior surface corresponds to the tensor fasciae latae and its tendon as well as to the aponeurosis of the gluteus medius. The posterior surface corresponds with the iliotibial tract and the tendon insertions of the gluteus maximus. The average dimensions of the cadaver \"musculoaponeurotic area of the hip\" are as follows: length, 17.5 cm, and width, 11.5 cm. Using the \"clinicophotographic scaling system,\" the dimensions are as follows: length, 14.9 cm, and width, 10.3 cm. CONCLUSIONS: The \"musculoaponeurotic area of the hip\" was defined involving muscles, tendons, aponeurosis, fascia, subcutaneous cellular tissue, and skin. The borders were established using important anatomical points that determine the length and width of the area. The \"clinicophotographic scaling system\" was used to clinically calculate the length and width of the area. By examination and palpation, the borders and dimensions of this area could be determined."
