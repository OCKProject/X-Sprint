Here we show that VASP is generally highly expressed in normal breast tissue and breast cancer. We also show that the phosphorylation status of VASP at S322 can be predictive for breast cancer progression to an aggressive phenotype. Our data indicate that phosphorylation at S322 is gradually decreased from normal breast to DCIS, luminal/ER+, HER2+ and basal-like/TN phenotypes. Similarly, the expression levels of PKD2, the kinase that phosphorylates VASP at this site, are decreased in invasive ductal carcinoma samples of all three groups. Overall, the phosphorylation status of this residue may serve as an indicator of aggressiveness of breast tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>invasive</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>VASP</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Members of the Ena/VASP protein family, such as Mammalian Enabled (Mena), Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and Ena-VASP-like (EVL) have been linked to many human diseases [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In human breast cancer Mena and EVL have been shown to be regulated at the transcriptional level contributing to invasiveness. Mena is overexpressed in over 70% of primary breast cancers [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and in benign lesions that have high risk of transformation [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, overexpression of Mena decreases overall patient survival in HER2-positive cancers [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent data demonstrate that alternately-spliced isoforms of Mena drive tumor cell invasion [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. On the other hand, EVL-1 (a splice variant of EVL) seems to suppress the invasive phenotype in breast cancer by increasing actin bundling and decreasing protrusive activity of cells [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Subsequently, decreased expression of EVL-1 correlates with poor patient outcome due to high invasiveness [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast to Mena and EVL-1, VASP expression levels do not serve as good predictive tumor markers, since they are generally high in both normal tissue and cancer. Another issue is that VASP can be phosphorylated at multiple sites, and depending on its phosphorylation status, may act as a promoter or inhibitor of tumor progression [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>VASP function is defined by localization, tetramerization and different phosphorylation events [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several phosphorylated tyrosine, serine and threonine residues have been identified by mass spectroscopy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>), and so far five phosphorylation sites (Y39, S157, S239, T278 and S322) have been experimentally-confirmed and linked to cellular outcome [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Phosphorylation at S157 generally seems to mediate membrane localization of VASP [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although phosphorylation of VASP at S157 has been suggested as a marker for the potential of metastatic progression of prostate cancer [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], using this phosphorylation as a marker needs to be pursued with caution, since additional phosphorylations at S239/T278 or S322 can diverge the functions of VASP at the leading edge of migrating cells [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This can lead to opposite effects on the cell's potential to migrate, invade and metastasize. Phosphorylations at S239/T278 decrease F-actin accumulation and bundling [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while the phosphorylation at S322 increases F-actin accumulation [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Moreover, the cells&#x02019; propensity to increase F-actin accumulation in response to VASP phosphorylation at S322 leads to decreased cell migration [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>We here tested if phosphorylation of VASP at S157 and S322, two residues that have been shown to be phosphorylated by Protein Kinase D (PKD) and increase F-actin accumulation, can be indicative for invasive breast cancers. We found that phosphorylation of endogenous VASP in is mainly mediated by PKD2, and that active PKD2 mainly phosphorylates VASP at S322. Analyses of human samples indicate that both, decrease of PKD2 or phosphorylation of VASP at S322 may be predictive for an aggressive phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>The expression level of VASP is not predictive for breast cancer survival or subtype</title><p>To determine if the expression levels of VASP can be predictive for breast cancer patient survival we analyzed a set of 3455 patient samples for which gene expression data was available.

Therefore, we first compared samples of normal breast tissue to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Immunofluorescence analysis of total VASP indicated high expression in both normal tissue and TNBC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, red immunofluorescence). Phosphorylation at S157 showed patchy staining in normal and TNBC, with high variations in different samples (not shown), whereas S239 phosphorylation was low in both (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, rows one and two, green fluorescence). The most significant difference was observed when we probed for S322 phosphorylation, which was high in normal and low, almost absent in TNBC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, row three, green fluorescence). Since the immunofluorescence data indicated that changes in the status of S322 (and possibly S157, although patchy) could be predictive for a progression of breast cancer to a more aggressive and invasive phenotype we next analyzed a larger set of patient samples for these two phosphorylations. Immunohistochemical (DAB staining) analysis of progression tissue microarrays (TMAs) including normal breast tissue, ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS), 3 groups of invasive ductal carcinomas (ER positive; HER2 positive; or TN) indicated that levels of total VASP are not indicative for progression (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We also did not observe a clear trend between samples for phosphorylation at S157. There even was a slight, but significant increase in phosphorylation in DCIS, ER+ IDC, HER2+ IDC and ILC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Analysis of phosphorylation at S322 indicated a clear trend. We found that all samples of IDC showed significantly less phosphorylation at this site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), whereas levels in DCIS and ILC were comparable to normal tissue. Within the group of IDC, we observed a gradual decrease in S322 phosphorylation with increasing aggressiveness of breast cancers (compare ER+ to HER2+ to TN groups).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of VASP at S157 and S322 is decreased in triple-negative breast cancer</title><p><bold>A.</bold> Immunofluorescence staining of serial sections of normal breast tissue or TNBC.

We also have shown that both phosphorylations can be mimicked with serine to glutamate mutations at these sites [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In human mammary epithelial cells (HuMEC), endogenous VASP mainly is localized at the focal contacts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Mimicking phosphorylations at S157 and S322 in HuMEC also resulted in increased localization of VASP at the leading edge (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and decreased directed cell migration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). While phosphorylation at S157 is necessary for membrane localization [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], phosphorylation at S322 regulates actin reorganization processes once VASP is located to the membrane [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, a downregulation of both phosphorylations may be required for invasive cells to increase motility. Indeed, our data using single mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) indicate that both phosphorylations are required in order to efficiently block migration. Similar additive effects of both phosphorylations on cell migration and cell invasion were also observed in highly motile MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Mimicking S157 and S322 phosphorylations inhibits directed cell migration</title><p><bold>A.</bold> HuMEC cells were fixed and stained for endogenous VASP by immunofluorescence. <bold>B.</bold> HuMEC cells were transfected with GFP-tagged VASP or VASP.S157E.S322E.

In order to determine if there is a preference of one of the three PKD isoforms for VASP as a substrate, we first ectopically-expressed active versions of all three isoforms together with FLAG-tagged VASP in cells and analyzed for phosphorylations. Surprisingly, as compared to active PKD2, active alleles of PKD1 and PKD3 only led to a weak phosphorylation of VASP at S157 and S322 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This suggested that of the PKD family members, PKD2 may be the kinase that mediates phosphorylation of VASP at both sites under endogenous conditions. To test this we again expressed active versions of all three PKD isoforms, but immunoprecipitated and analyzed endogenous VASP. Our data clearly indicate that phosphorylation of endogenous VASP at both residues (S157 and S322) is a PKD2-specific event (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However, introducing an active mutant of RhoA to activate PKD2, led to only weak phosphorylation of endogenous VASP at S157 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), but a significant increase in S322 phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>).

For example, VASP regulates F-actin filament elongation and bundling and contributes to cell-cell adhesions, focal adhesions and filopodia formation [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The expression levels of the Ena/VASP protein family members Mena and EVL-1 have been linked to patient outcome in breast cancer, whereas VASP has been described as expressed in relatively high levels in normal as well as cancer tissue. Only in lung adenocarcinomas increased VASP expression was described when compared to normal epithelium [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, in cell culture experiments homozygous knockout of VASP suggested rather an inhibitory role for VASP on soft agar colony and tumor formation [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Here, we used several available databases to determine if VASP expression in breast cancer can be linked to patient survival or tumor type. Initially, as control, we included the two other family members Mena (<italic>ENAH</italic>) and EVL (<italic>EVL</italic>) into our studies. Mena, for example, has been described to be overexpressed in over 70% of primary breast cancers [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and in invasive mammary tumor cells [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, it was suggested that high expression decreases overall patient survival in HER2-positive cancers [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While our analysis of alterations in breast cancer samples confirms that mRNA upregulation or gene amplification of Mena frequently occurs in all types of invasive breast cancer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), Kaplan-Meier Plot analysis of a set of 3455 patients for relapse-free survival (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) did not suggest any correlation between Mena expression levels and patient survival. We also did not observe significant differences in expression of Mena in cell lines between luminal and basal phenotypes. However, it also was shown that alternative splicing of Mena is needed to produce an invasion-promoting isoform [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and the databases used do not allow us to distinguish between splice forms for our analysis. For EVL-1, a splice variant of EVL, it was previously shown that decreased expression correlates with poor patient outcome due to high invasiveness [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Like VASP, EVL-1 can be regulated by PKD through phosphorylation, however at a different residue [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, although the phosphorylation of EVL-1 by PKD1 has been shown to occur in lamellipodia, filopodia and at cell-cell contacts, so far no information exists if it is predictive for aggressiveness of human breast cancer.</p><p>Like previously shown for EVL-1, our data now confirm for EVL that decreased expression correlates with poor patient outcome (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), but also expand this and implicate that mRNA downregulation may mainly occur in samples or cell lines of the basal-like phenotype (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, 1C</xref>). The conclusion from our analyses is that levels of EVL expression can indeed serve as predictive marker for patient survival. For VASP we found only a marginal difference in relapse-free survival between patients with high or low expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Similarly, in cell lines, the VASP expression status was not significantly different between the luminal or basal subtypes, nor when samples were grouped conventionally (TN, HER2+ or HR+).</p><p>A caveat of &#x0201c;only&#x0201d; looking at expression levels is that VASP can be phosphorylated at multiple sites with different outcome, and dependent on its phosphorylation pattern, VASP may act as a promoter or inhibitor of tumor progression [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Some attempts have been made to link phosphorylation of VASP at certain residues to tumor survival or progression. For example, S157 phosphorylation of VASP has been suggested as a marker for prostate cancer cell motility and potential of metastatic progression [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the phosphorylation status at S157 alone is not indicative for cancer cell motility. Phosphorylation of S157 drives VASP to the leading edge, but additional phosphorylations at S239/T278 or S322 bifurcate VASP functions in respect to F-actin accumulation, filopodia formation and cell migration. We here tested if these phosphorylations can serve as more conclusive markers for tumor aggressiveness. Due to the lack of appropriate antibody tools other phosphorylations of VASP (i.e. Y39) currently cannot be assessed for their use as predictive markers for breast cancer progression. Of these especially Y39 phosphorylation of VASP which is mediated by the tyrosine kinase Abl may be of interest [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because Abl is an upstream kinase for PKD [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the phosphorylation of Y39 may be functionally linked to S322 phosphorylation and expression patterns for pS322 and pY39 may overlap.</p><p>Phosphorylations of VASP at S239 and T278 are mainly mediated by PKA, PKG and AMPK [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; and suppress motility in cancer cells and colon cancer [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We did not detect significant changes in phosphorylation of VASP at S239 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, and <italic>data not shown</italic> for analysis of TMAs) or T278 (not shown) when comparing normal breast tissue to patient samples. Therefore, we focused on phosphorylation at S322, which can be mediated by PKD enzymes (mainly PKD2 as demonstrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and (in combination with S157 phosphorylation) decreases directed cell migration [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At this point it is unclear if in invasive breast cancer cells and tissue VASP phosphorylation at both sites is exclusively regulated PKD2, since both also can be targeted by AMPK, a metabolic gauge associated with tumorigenesis [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>PKD enzymes are downstream of RhoGTPases (discussed in [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]). PKD1 for example has been shown to be activated by RhoA, while it is negatively regulated by Rac-1 [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition to VASP several other signaling molecules that contribute to cell migration are targeted by RhoA-regulated activation of PKD enzymes [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, although PKD2 also is regulated by RhoA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]), only little is known on its substrates.</p><p>Our data indicate that VASP expression levels cannot be used as predictive markers for type or outcome in breast cancer. The phosphorylation status at S322, however, correlates with aggressiveness and a gradual decrease is observed in IDC from ER+ to HER2+ to TN cancers, while it is not indicative for invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Overall, the phosphorylation status of this residue may serve as both an indicator of aggressiveness of invasive breast tumors of ductal origin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Antibodies, reagents, DNA constructs and cell lines</title><p>HuMEC cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were maintained in HMEC Culture System from Invitrogen.
