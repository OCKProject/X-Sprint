Recombinant-CASK (rCASK) induced the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in immortalized podocytes, a redistribution of synaptopodin, ZO-1,vinculin and ENA. rCASK also induced alterations in the permeability of a monolayer of podocytes and increased the motility of pdodocytes in vitro. The extracellular domain of CD98, a transmembrane receptor expressed on renal epithelial cells, has been found to co-immunoprecipitated with rCASK.

Alterations in glomerular organization are of clinical importance in renal diseases, as they can lead to proteinuria and the development of chronic kidney disease. Podocytes are critical in maintaining the function of glomerular filtration through two main interrelated elements: <italic>i)</italic> the interdigitating foot processes, which are actin-based structures, and <italic>ii)</italic> the slit diaphragm, which is a set of transmembrane proteins that spread from adjacent interdigitating foot processes to form a zipper-like scaffold. These structures maintain the organization of the foot processes and are therefore critical to the function of the glomerular-filtration barrier. These interactions are strongly compromised in minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which are associated with structural and functional alteration of podocytes, such as the effacement of foot processes leading to proteinuria in those patients [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>FSGS accounts for 20% of all cases of nephrotic syndrome in both children and adults [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FSGS may be secondary to various diseases (e.g., obesity, HIV infection), associated with gene mutations in proteins involved in the organization of foot processes such as podocine, nephrin, CD2AP, alpha actinin-4 [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], or idiopathic. This idiopathic form of FSGS has a poor prognosis and can progress to end-stage renal disease within 3&#x02013;7 years. This form relapses in 30&#x02013;50% of cases after a first renal transplantation (rFSGS) and in up to 90% after a second graft [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Its occurrence after vaccination and viral infection and its sensitivity to immunosuppressive drugs suggest that the misregulation of the immune system may participate in the development of this disorder [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The existence of a soluble factor of permeability (SFP) that causes glomerular protein leakage has been proposed because either plasmapheresis or protein-A immunoadsorption rapidly reduces proteinuria [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, the injection of plasma from patients with rFSGS or eluates from protein-A immunoadsorption induces proteinuria in experimental animals [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], suggesting that SFP binds to protein-A columns. Several SFPs, including suPAR, cardiotrophin-like cytokine-1, and autoantibodies such as anti-CD40, have been described, but their validation as causal agents or biomarkers for rFSGS has not been completed [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In this study, using mass spectrometry (MS), we analyzed proteins eluted from protein-A columns that were taken from patients with early rFSGS after renal transplantation. We identified the presence of a serum form of calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK), suggesting its involvement in rFSGS. CASK is a membrane-associated kinase that mediates many protein-protein interactions in several cell types, including podocytes [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]and neurons [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Previous studies have demonstrated that an extracellular form of CASK is capable to bind CD98 onto CaCO-2 cells[<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. CD98 is expressed at the basolateral domain of intestinal cells and its function depends of the molecules associated with. It can interact with heterodimeric aminoacid transportor (HAT-1) playing together a role as aminoacid transporter but also with different &#x003b2;1 or &#x003b2;3 integrins or CD147 modulating cell adhesion or migration [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first evidence of the presence of an extracellular form of CASK in serum that induces structural and functional alterations in podocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Patients</title><p>The clinical characteristics, treatments and evolutionof patients with rFSGS and the clinical characteristics of controls are summarized in Tables <xref rid="pone.0219353.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0219353.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref> (respectively).

The idiopathic form can relapse very rapidly after transplantation, suggesting the presence of an SFP that can be removed from the blood of patients through its binding to protein-A columns, leading to a reduction of proteinuria [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We used this binding capability of protein-A to identify the SFP(s) using an MS approach. Comparing proteins eluted after protein-A immunoadsorption, we identified a serum form of CASK, which was detected only in the sera of patients with rFSGS, but not in healthy individuals, in kidney-transplant patients without proteinuria, patients with significant proteinuria caused by diabetic nephropathy, minimal change disease, or membranous glomerulonephritis.</p><p>Human rCASK induced alterations to murine podocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>; these alterations were associated with proteinuria in mice. Other molecules have been proposed as potential SFPs, but their roles are still under debate [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that the urokinase plasminogen-activator receptor (suPAR) is the soluble factor associated with glomerular permeability and is responsible for primary FSGS and rFSGS [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the specificity of suPAR as a biomarker for FSGS is controversial, as high levels of serum suPAR have also been found in other pathological conditions, regardless of the existence of proteinuria [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], such as HIV-1 or bacterial infections, malaria, and various types of cancer not necessarily associated with nephrotic syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. More recently, Delville and colleagues, using a peptide-array system, identified a panel of seven antibodies capable of predicting post-transplant FSGS recurrence with 92% accuracy [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among them, anti-CD40 caused cytoskeleton alterations in podocyte cell culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> when it was coinjected with suPAR. The authors suggested a costimulatory function for both CD40 and suPAR, but larger studies are required to validate this hypothesis.</p><p>Protein-A immunoadsorption <italic>in vivo</italic> induced a decrease in proteinuria in patients with rFSGS, suggesting that SFP is efficiently removed by this procedure [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unlike suPAR [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], CASK was efficiently retained by protein-A columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0219353.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting a high affinity of CASK to protein-A. However, it cannot be excluded that alternative complexes of CASK-Ig are formed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The existence of a serum form of CASK has not been described before. CASK is a multidomain scaffold protein ubiquitously expressed, mainly in neurons and podocytes. It mediates a link between the extracellular matrix and the actin and therefore participates in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Mutations of CASK have beenassociated with intellectual disability, microcephaly and cerebellar hypoplasia [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, it has been observed <italic>in vitro</italic> that CASK interacts with the extracellular domain of CD98 in CaCo2 cell lines and on intestinal sections. CD98 is a type 2 transmembrane protein with a PDZ binding domain in its extracellular part and regulates the heteromeric amino acid transporter (HAT) as well as acts as integrin &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 co-receptor and might regulates adhesion and migration of cells. HAT acts as an exchanger transferring large cationic, neutral proteins and negatively charged amino acids [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. CD98 also regulates adhesion and migration of cells and the signaling pathway downstream integrin such as the FAK and Akt. In human, CD98 has been shown to be associated with cell proliferation and tumor growth [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This suggests that destabilization of CD98 could favor protein or amino acid release in urine and podocyte detachment.</p><p>In our work, one hypothesis for the presence of CASK in sera could be that serum CASK was released from damaged cells. However, no increase in any other intracellular protein from blood cells or podocytes has been observed in blood samples from patients with rFSGS, which suggests that the presence of CASK does not reflect cell lysis or podocyte injury. Immunosuppressive drugs are known to partially control primary FSGS flare-ups as well as the relapsed form after transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that CASK could be produced/secreted by an immune cell subset that requires complete characterization.</p><p>In our study, a pathological effect was confirmed by a single intravenous injection of rCASK, which increased albuminuria in mice and induced effacement of the podocyte foot processes. These alterations in podocyte shape require the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, a process that leads to FSGS [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As we have observed, CASK induced morphological rearrangement of podocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, as evidenced by the following: <italic>i)</italic> alterations in the permeability of the podocyte monolayers and <italic>ii)</italic> cytoskeleton alterations (reorganization of actin, synaptopodin, mENA or junction proteins such as ZO-1). These alterations are similar to others that are widely described for this disease [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In addition, these alterations induced an increase in cell motility that is in accordance with the observed alterations in stress fibers. However, this effect was observed in the presence of a high concentration (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) of rCASK, which may be related to a low affinity effect induced by CASK.</p><p>The presence of an extracellular form of CASK has already been reported <italic>in vitro</italic> and on intestinal sections [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. CASK has been shown to bind to the basolateral membranes of intestinal epithelial cell lines through direct interaction with the extracellular domain of CD98 (heavy chain) [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This protein has been found on the surface of many activated cell types and has been implicated in the regulation of cellular differentiation, adhesion, growth, and apoptosis [<xref rid="pone.0219353.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms by which CD98 mediates in such functions. However, it can interact with other transmembrane proteins, such as &#x003b2;1 and &#x003b2;3 integrins and CD147. Accordingly, the involvement of CASK/CD98 in the pathogenesis of FSGS is a very attractive hypothesis that needs to be explored.</p><p>In conclusion, we propose that the serum form of CASK is a newly discovered factor that needs to be considered in the etiopathology of FSGS. Herein, we describe, for the first time, a potential pathological system that could be used as a new biomarker or therapeutic target for rFSGS. This is based on the existence of soluble CASK that is potentially secreted into the sera of rFSGS patients. This soluble form of CASK could interact with renal podocytes (perhaps through CD98) at the membrane level to trigger cytoskeleton disorganization and then lead to proteinuria. Further studies will be necessary to validate this new model in greater detail.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0219353.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>A- Distribution of Podocin in podocytes incubated with or without rCASK for 24 hours.
