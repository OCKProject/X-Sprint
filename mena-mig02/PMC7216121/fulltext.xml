This approach allowed us to evaluate how melanoma cell motility was impacted by the lack of either &#x003b2; actin coded by <italic>ACTB</italic> or &#x003b3; actin coded by <italic>ACTG1</italic>. First, we observed different distributions of &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin in the cells, and the absence of one actin isoform was compensated for via increased expression of the other isoform. Moreover, we noted that &#x003b3; actin knockout had more severe consequences on cell migration and invasion than &#x003b2; actin knockout. Next, we observed that the formation rate of bundled stress fibers in CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells was increased, but lamellipodial activity in these cells was impaired, compared to controls. Finally, we discovered that the formation rate of focal adhesions (FAs) and, subsequently, FA-dependent signaling were altered in both the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones; however, a more detrimental effect was observed for &#x003b3; actin-deficient cells.

Introduction</title><p>The actin cytoskeleton is essential for the proper functioning of many cellular processes, including maintenance of the cell shape, chemotaxis, cell movement, adhesion, transport of cellular organelles, mitosis, replication, transcription, and even DNA repair [<xref rid="B1-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such a wide array of functions must be coordinated by several signaling pathways, which often intersect with each other, and a number of proteins. There are more than 200 actin-binding proteins (ABPs), which are responsible for the nucleation of actin polymerization as well as branching, crosslinking, and stabilization, but also severing of polymerized actin (filamentous actin, F-actin). Some ABPs, due to their activity in actin monomer sequestration, contribute to the maintenance of the cell&#x02019;s monomeric actin pool (globular actin, G-actin) [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In a cell, there are linear and branched actin filament networks. The spatial organization of a particular actin network and the type of ABPs associated with that network determine the type of F-actin-based subcellular structure. The lamellipodium, which is involved in cell movement, is a dynamic structure that is composed of a dense network of short and branched actin filaments. Stress fibers, which consist of about 10&#x02013;30 microfilaments aligned in parallel, are partly responsible for cell contraction and adhesion [<xref rid="B3-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other structures built by F-actin in tumor cells are invadopodia, which, due to the secretion of metalloproteases, are responsible for proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix and, thus, participate in the adhesion and migration/invasion of neoplastic cells [<xref rid="B6-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In higher vertebrates, including mammals, there are four muscle isoforms and two non-muscle isoforms of actin [<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and although actins have been intensively studied for several decades, there are still controversies about the functional diversification of non-muscle isoactins (&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin), which differ by only four amino acids within their N-termini [<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Their different properties are explained, on the one hand, by protein features that manifest through dissimilar polymerization dynamics [<xref rid="B11-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], divergent interactions with ABPs [<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and discrepancies in posttranslational modifications [<xref rid="B13-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, it is claimed that it is not the isoactins&#x02019; amino acid sequence but instead their nucleotide sequence that is more relevant for these differences [<xref rid="B14-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which are mirrored in mRNA trafficking [<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and the speed of isoactin biosynthesis [<xref rid="B16-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the existence of two extremely similar actin isoforms has to be of high relevance since their expression patterns differ in various tissues (summarized in [<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), although their protein levels are similar in most cell types. Supporting this notion, mutations in genes encoding &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actins give different outcomes in, e.g., patients with Baraitser&#x02013;Winter cerebrofrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF), where the cases with <italic>ACTB</italic> mutations are associated with severe forms of this condition, whereas cases with mutations in <italic>ACTG1</italic> are restricted to brain malformations [<xref rid="B17-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><p>Because there is no consensus regarding the purpose of the existence of two non-muscle actins, it is of high importance to study the functions of &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin. Several published studies aimed to elucidate the roles of non-muscle actins by overexpression, silencing, or knockout of the coding sequences for &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin (reviewed by [<xref rid="B7-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). However, in the overexpression and silencing studies, endogenous isoactins were present in the tested cells, which could have affected the results, whereas the knockout studies were conducted using normal cells, e.g., murine fibroblasts. In our studies, we focused on melanoma cells since this very aggressive tumor is characterized by its high plasticity [<xref rid="B19-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and the ability to form tumors from a single transformed cell [<xref rid="B20-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This makes melanoma a perfect model to investigate the role of the aforementioned actin isoforms in migration. Moreover, as far as we know, there is no previous research that aimed to simultaneously estimate the role of the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actins in melanoma cell migration. Here, by inactivation the genes encoding the &#x003b2; (<italic>ACTB</italic>) and &#x003b3; (<italic>ACTG1</italic>) actins with the help of the RNA-guided D10A mutated Cas9 nuclease gene editing, CRISPR/Cas9(D10A), system in A375 cells, we report, for the first time, that the lack of &#x003b3; actin had the most severe consequences on A375 cells and these non-muscle actins are unequal in their features, particularly their influence on the formation of focal adhesions (FAs) and protrusive structures and, thus, the motility of melanoma cells. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-ijms-21-02746"><title>2. Results</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijms-21-02746"><title>2.1. Both Non-Muscle Actins Are Highly Abundant in A375 Cells but Occupy Different Areas of the Cell</title><p>Prior to subjecting the cells to the CRISPR/Cas9(D10A) procedure, we examined the expression level of both non-muscle actins in melanoma cells. In all the melanoma cell lines we tested, we noted various levels of the transcripts that encode both of the non-muscle isoactins (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S1</xref>). Upon normalization of the results to A375 cells there were statistically significant differences in <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> expression for other melanoma cells lines when compared to A375 cells, however the differences were not so high varying form ca. 0.5- to 2-fold. Nevertheless, given the strict regulation of expression of the actin-encoding genes, even about twice as high <italic>ACTB</italic> expression (WM1341D cells) or twice as low <italic>ACTG1</italic> (WM9 cells) may have important implications for cell biology. For this study, we chose the A375 cell line as it is a cell line that was isolated from primary melanoma localized within skin with the potential to form metastases and it is easy to transfect. First, we looked at the distribution of &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin in A375 cells. The specificity of the antibodies used in this study to detect both isoactins was checked using recombinant &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S2</xref>). Two types of antibodies against &#x003b2; actin and another two against &#x003b3; actin were proven to be specific, as declared by the manufacturers. We noted that &#x003b2; actin in A375 was incorporated in F-actin structures, such as stress fibers and invadopodia, whereas &#x003b3; actin, apart from being present in these structures as well, was also very prominently present as the dense actin mesh, both in the perinuclear area and within lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). This was particularly easy to observe with double staining, where G-actin was detected together with &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Both actins seemed to be expressed at similar levels in these cells, as revealed by 2-D PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). Simultaneous detection of both non-muscle actins in A375 cells revealed that the distribution of fluorescently labeled actins differed: &#x003b2; actin was more frequently located within actin bundles and &#x003b3; actin at the periphery of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). Histograms of the fluorescence signals that represent &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin, conducted from the middle of the cell towards its border, clearly show that the fluorescence signal coming from the detection of &#x003b2; actin did not overlap with the &#x003b3; actin fluorescence signal along the whole measured distance of the cell. However, intriguingly, a colocalization between these two non-muscle actins was observed at the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). These observations indicate that both &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin have partially different localizations in a cell. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijms-21-02746"><title>2.2. Successful Knockout of Genes Coding for &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; Actin Leads to Altered Non-Muscle Isoactin Expression and Affects Cells&#x02019; Migration</title><p>In order to test the hypothesis that &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin have different functions in A375 cells, we decided to knock out the <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> genes via the CRISPR/Cas9(D10A) technique. We successfully obtained these lines, which we confirmed by genomic DNA (gDNA) (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S3A</xref>), Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S3B</xref>), and qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>C) analyses and by immunocytochemical staining of the obtained clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S4</xref>). Apart from cells devoid of &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin synthesis, we also obtained control cells, i.e., clones transfected with CRISPR/Cas9(D10A) plasmids that code for scrambled guide RNAs, gRNAs. The control clones had normal levels of both of the non-muscle actins (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S3C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed compensation after the depletion of one isoform, i.e., upregulation of the level of the other isoform. This was seen in both the Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B) and microscopic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>D,E, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S4</xref>). In the Western blot analysis, we observed this occurrence only if we lysed the cells in the lysis buffer used for 2-D PAGE, which contains high levels of urea and thiourea and, thus, better extracts the proteins associated with the detergent-resistant membrane fractions of the cells. When we used cytoskeletal-bound protein extraction buffer, we did not observe any compensation (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S5</xref>). For all the other Western blot analyses, we used cytoskeletal-bound protein extraction buffer. A closer look at the stained cells revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>F) that in the case of CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> [clones with inactivated <italic>ACTB</italic> with the help of CRISPR/Cas9(D10A) technique] cells, the elevated levels of &#x003b3; actin manifested more prominently in structures that are characteristic for this isoform, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B. A similar observation was made for the &#x003b2; actin distribution in A375 CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> [clones with inactivated <italic>ACTG1</italic> with the help of CRISPR/Cas9(D10A) technique] cells. Here, the stress fibers&#x02019; formation was more pronounced than in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>F); this was reflected in the elevated filamentous (F) to globular (G) actin ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>G) and more pronounced staining for F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>H) in CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells. In the case of the cells without &#x003b2; actin, the F:G actin ratio was unchanged in comparison to the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>G) and the F-actin staining patterns were similar between the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> clones and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f002">Figure 2</xref>H). These results show that the CRISPR/Cas9(D10A) technique is suitable for knocking out <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> and that the obtained clones have altered actin cytoskeleton architecture.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijms-21-02746"><title>2.3. Migration and Invasion Are Affected in the CR-ACTB Clones and Greatly Affected in the CR-ACTG1 Clones</title><p>Because there were discrepancies, in terms of actin architecture, between the studied clones, we checked the influence of depletion of &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin on the cells&#x02019; ability to migrate and invade. The distance covered by the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B) and their movement speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>C) was similar to the results obtained for the control cells, but, surprisingly, the directionality of the &#x003b2; actin-devoid cells was changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). In contrast, the 2-D migration of the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones was severely affected. The distances covered by these cells and their velocity were statistically significantly lowered in comparison to the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;C), but their directionality was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>D). The increased directionality of the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells was reflected in the higher collective migration of these cells, compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>E, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S7</xref>). Again, for the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, we observed less migration than for the control (CR-CTRL) clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>E, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S7</xref>). Next, we wanted to check the 3-D migration abilities of the studied cells and for that we used Transwell&#x02122; filters filled with Matrigel&#x02122; gel to mimic basement membrane. For the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones, we noted that fewer cells were capable of crossing the 3-D matrix towards the medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>F). Intriguingly, we observed that in these cells the number of invadopodia was higher than in the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>G,H). This was even more drastic in the case of CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells since the number of invadopodia was much higher than in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> clones. Additionally, we observed that the area digested by metalloproteases in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells was larger than that of the control cells, although the differences were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>I). Next, we stained the cells for cofilin and cortactin, two proteins that are important for invadopodia formation [<xref rid="B21-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This staining revealed that both cofilin and cortactin are indeed present in these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>J); however, cofilin, unlike cortactin, is not present to the same extent in invadopodia for the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells as it is in the control cells. This was especially evident in the fluorescence intensity plot profiles of the presence of cortactin and cofilin at invadopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>J). Afterwards, we checked the levels of cofilin and its phosphorylated form (p-cofilin). We noted that the levels of total cofilin were highly increased in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, when compared to control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>K, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S8</xref>); however, we only observed a statistically higher amount of p-cofilin<sup>3</sup> in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells, compared to the control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>K, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S8</xref>). We estimated the p-cofilin<sup>3</sup>:cofilin ratios for all the cell types and noted that the ratio statistically significantly increased only for CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells, although we observed a similar tendency in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f003">Figure 3</xref>L). In summary, a lack of &#x003b3; actin has more severe consequences on the cells&#x02019; 2-D and 3-D migration than a lack of &#x003b2; actin. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijms-21-02746"><title>2.4. Bundling of Stress Fibers Is Altered in Clones that Lack Either &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; Actin</title><p>Subsequently, we checked the formation of F-actin-rich structures as they are directly involved in cell motility. We incubated cells that were starved for 24 h with 1 micromolar (&#x003bc;M) lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) for 10 min in order to challenge the cells to form stress fibers [<xref rid="B23-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>A), and we calculated the number of &#x0201c;thick&#x0201d; stress fiber bundles, plotting a histogram of fluorescence over the cell length and identifying the number of fluorescent values that were higher or equal to 75% of the highest fluorescence peak. The highest number of these structures was noted in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones with LPA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Interestingly, in the case of control cells and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, there were more thick stress fiber bundles after stimulation than in nonstimulated cells, whereas this was not true in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells. We then looked at activation of Rho-GTPases upon LPA stimulation, as LPA is a Rho activator [<xref rid="B23-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After the addition of LPA, a statistically significant decrease in the level of active RhoA was observed only in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). The levels of Rac1 and Cdc42 activity were similar between the clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Next, we evaluated the F:G actin ratio; this ratio was similar in all three cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>D), although there was a tendency toward a decrease for the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells. Next, we looked at the distribution of the human FH1/FH2 domain-containing protein 1, FHOD1, formin (a microfilament bundling and capping protein [<xref rid="B24-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]), and Myosin IIa, an actin motor protein that possesses microfilament bundling activity [<xref rid="B25-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While we did not observe any changes in the cellular distribution of FHOD1, the Myosin IIa staining pattern was altered in CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>E). The signal for Myosin IIa in these cells was not homogenously distributed, as in the control cells, but instead clear, thick bundles were seen. Although this was not reflected in the results of the analysis of averaged histograms, which represent the fluorescence signal of detected FHOD1 or Myosin IIa, it was mirrored in the plot profiles of representative cells for every condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>F). Moreover, the FHOD1 and Myosin IIa levels were similar in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic>, CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic>, and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>G, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S9</xref>). We also checked the phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) levels, as pMLC is an indicator of myosin ATPase activity and, thus, activation of the contractile apparatus [<xref rid="B26-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The pMLC levels were similar among all the cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>G, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S9</xref>). Although there were no differences in the levels of Myosin IIa or pMLC between the different clones after LPA stimulation, when grown in full medium, significantly higher levels of Myosin IIa and pMLC were exhibited by the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells and the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones had lower basal levels of FHOD1 (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S10</xref>). Finally, we stained the cells for pMLC and we noticed a strong decoration of stress fibers with pMLC in control and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, but not in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f004">Figure 4</xref>H).

Lamellipodial Dynamics Are Altered in Cells Devoid of Either &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; Actin</title><p>Since we checked the clones&#x02019; ability to form stress fibers, we also looked at the other F-actin protrusive structures, lamellipodia. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) stimulation was performed to induce formation of lamellipodia [<xref rid="B27-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. F-actin staining in fixed cells and analysis of micrographs revealed that cells devoid of &#x003b3; actin formed narrower and thinner leading edges than did control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f005">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;C). The width and the thickness of lamellipodium were measured by plotting a histogram of fluorescence over the lamellipodium, and using a ruler in the software or reading the whole intensity of fluorescence through the lamellipodium, respectively. In the case of the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells, there were no differences in these aspects compared to controls. Afterwards, we performed live imaging analysis of clones that were transfected with a plasmid that encoded LifeAct-TagRFP in order to track F-actin in real time upon PMA stimulation. Analysis of the kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f005">Figure 5</xref>D) showed that the dynamics of F-actin within the leading edge were more prominent in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells than in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f005">Figure 5</xref>D&#x02013;F). Although, in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, there was no difference in the lamellipodial dynamics between the PMA-stimulated and nonstimulated groups, the overall lamellipodial dynamics were lower in those cells in comparison to those present in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f005">Figure 5</xref>F). Next, we evaluated the activation of Rho-GTPases upon PMA stimulation versus nonstimulated cells. We evaluated activity of GTPases with activation assays (G-LISA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) detecting given GTPase bound with GTP in cells lysates. Increased Rac1 activity was noted in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f005">Figure 5</xref>G); however, we did not observe any changes in the RhoA or Cdc42 activity between the clones in response to PMA treatment. The F:G actin ratio was also checked and a statistically significant decrease was noted only for the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f005">Figure 5</xref>H). Altogether, these observations imply that while the leading edge dynamics were increased in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells, the opposite effect was observed for CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, when compared to control cells. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-ijms-21-02746"><title>2.6. There Are Differences in the Distribution and Levels of Actin Polymerization Nucleators within the Leading Edge</title><p>Because we noticed divergences between the clones in terms of their leading edge dynamics, we decided to look at proteins that trigger actin polymerization and reside in the leading edge. Upon exposure to PMA, the cells were fixed and stained for vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and actin-related protein 3 (Arp3) as these proteins are the nucleators of actin polymerization within the lamellipodium [<xref rid="B28-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We found that both proteins were prominent at the leading edges of all the analyzed cell types; however, the presence of VASP was more pronounced in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones, whereas the Arp3 level was diminished in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f006">Figure 6</xref>A,B). The presence of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family member 2 (WAVE-2), two activators of Arp3, was also evaluated; while the amount of N-WASP was significantly increased at the leading edges of CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells, there were no observed differences in the amount of WAVE-2 between the tested clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f006">Figure 6</xref>C,D). Interestingly, we observed that VASP colocalized with Arp3 within circular dorsal ruffles (CDRs) in all the tested clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). We also noticed the presence of Arp3 and WAVE-2 at the leading edges and CDRs in all the tested clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f006">Figure 6</xref>C). Western blot analysis showed that there was less N-WASP in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, whereas the level of Arp3 was increased in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f006">Figure 6</xref>E, <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S11</xref>). We also checked the levels of those proteins under full medium conditions.

Similarly, there was an increase in the level of Arp3 in both CRISPR clone types when compared to controls. There were no notable changes in the levels of WAVE-2 between the cell types (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S12</xref>). These observations suggest that alterations in the leading edge dynamics could be at least partially caused by changes in the subcellular distribution and amount of the proteins studied here. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-ijms-21-02746"><title>2.7. Focal Adhesion (FA) Formation Is Changed in the Clones Devoid of Either &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; Actin</title><p>Because VASP is not only found at the leading edge of a cell, but also in FAs and we have noticed differences in its presence at the leading edge between cell types, we decided to evaluate the FA formation in cells grown in full medium or under LPA or PMA stimulation conditions. For this purpose, we stimulated the cells, fixed them, and stained for two proteins present in FAs, VASP and &#x003b1;-parvin. Both proteins colocalized with integrin &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3, a known constituent of FAs (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S13</xref>). Closer analysis of stained cells revealed that VASP is also present in these FAs, just like &#x003b1;-parvin, but not only there; there is a subtle accumulation of VASP in the submembranous area of a cell, which is highlighted by arrows in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-21-02746">Figure S13</xref>. The same was observed in nonmanipulated A375 cells stained with antibodies that recognize VASP or &#x003b1;-parvin and total actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). In the case of &#x003b1;-parvin, we observed this protein solely at the tips of stress fibers. On the other hand, we noted a clear VASP localization at the tips of stress fibers, but also in submembranous aggregates that were also positive for total actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). We consider these structures as nascent FAs that were most likely devoid of &#x003b1;-parvin at this stage of formation. Using photos of the cells with immunofluorescently detected &#x003b1;-parvin and VASP, we calculated and measured the number of FAs and their areas, respectively. In the case of staining with anti-VASP antibodies, some puncta were so small that we did not include measurements of their areas in order to avoid introducing any artifacts, and, therefore, the FAs&#x02019; areas were measured only for &#x003b1;-parvin-positive FA staining. The acquired results show that, under full medium conditions, the number of &#x003b1;-parvin-rich FAs was statistically significantly elevated in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, in comparison to control cells, but, surprisingly, their surface area was decreased only in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f007">Figure 7</xref>B,C). There were more VASP puncta in cells without &#x003b2; actin when compared to the control clones, whereas the greatest number of VASP puncta was observed in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f007">Figure 7</xref>B,D). LPA incubation of the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells resulted in almost twice as many &#x003b1;-parvin-rich FAs in comparison to controls, whereas their surface area was increased only in the cells devoid of &#x003b3; actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f007">Figure 7</xref>E,F). The number of VASP-rich nascent FAs and FAs was increased in both the &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin knockout cells upon LPA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f007">Figure 7</xref>E,G). We also checked the impact of PMA on the number of FAs. We noted no changes in the number of &#x003b1;-parvin-rich FAs in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f007">Figure 7</xref>H,I). The FA surface area was bigger in the clones without &#x003b2; actin, but surprisingly smaller in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, compared to control cells. </p><p>Subsequently, we compared the results for all the clones concerning the numbers and sizes of FAs upon LPA or PMA stimulation under full medium conditions by employing slope graphs. We observed the same tendency for all the tested cells, i.e., LPA and PMA incubation increased the number of &#x003b1;-parvin-rich FAs and PMA treatment decreased FA size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f008">Figure 8</xref>A,C). In the case of CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, we noted, surprisingly, an increase in the size of &#x003b1;-parvin-rich FAs upon LPA stimulation when compared to controls and CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells, for which a decrease was noted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f008">Figure 8</xref>A).

LPA incubation upregulated the pSrc<sup>530</sup> level in &#x003b2; actin-deficient clones, but PMA stimulation upregulated pSrc<sup>530</sup> in the &#x003b3; actin-deficient clones. Next, we looked at FAK activation and we noticed a decrease in the pFAK<sup>397</sup> level in CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells under all the tested conditions, compared to control cells.

In regard to melanoma cells, there is only one paper that addresses non-muscle actins&#x02019; role in these cells.

Because there was a gap in the knowledge about non-muscle actins&#x02019; involvement in melanoma cell biology, we decided to unveil the role of both isoactins in melanoma cells&#x02019; motility. </p><p>We noted that in genetically nonmanipulated A375 cells, &#x003b2; actin is predominantly present in stress fibers, whereas &#x003b3; actin is found mainly as a dense mesh in the cell body but also in stress fibers. Similar non-muscle isoactin subcellular localization was also observed by Dugina and her colleagues in fibroblasts, where &#x003b2; actin was predominantly present at cell&#x02013;cell contact sites, in stress fibers, and in circular bundles, whereas &#x003b3; actin was observed as a meshwork at the cortex and lamellipodium [<xref rid="B33-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For colon carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma cells, and keratinocytes, Dugina et al. obtained similar results, showing that &#x003b2; actin is mainly found in stress fibers, whereas &#x003b3; actin is localized submembranously [<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Analogous results were obtained by another group for neuroblastoma cells [<xref rid="B35-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. On the other hand, several papers have reported &#x003b2; actin localization in the lamellipodium [<xref rid="B36-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and &#x003b3; actin in microfilaments in the cytoplasm [<xref rid="B15-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B37-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Several studies reported compensation for the loss of one non-muscle actin isoform with overexpression of another actin isoform to restore the level of total actin [<xref rid="B39-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; we observed the same phenomenon. Higher expression of &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> or CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> clones, respectively, was corroborated by microscopic analysis. </p><p>Intriguingly, we found out that knocking out either &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin influenced the expression levels of some ABPs. The expression of several ABPs is regulated by serum response factor (SRF) [<xref rid="B42-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; however, our observations cannot be solely explained by changes in the F:G ratio leading to altered SRF signaling, resulting in up- or down-regulation of ABP expression. We justify our notion by the fact that VASP, &#x003b1;-parvin, and N-WASP were up- or down-regulated in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells under various conditions, whereas the expression of these proteins is not regulated by SRF. On the other hand, we noted changed levels of cofilin and Arp3, proteins whose expression depends on SRF [<xref rid="B42-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], in the cells deprived of either &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin. However, in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> clones, there were no changes in the F:G actin ratio. Alterations in ABPs expression levels were also noted by Latham and colleagues, who defined <italic>ACTB</italic>-AST, a new clinical entity manifested by microcephaly, intellectual disability, minor facial anomalies, white blood cell anomalies and thrombocytopenia caused by mutations clustered in the 3&#x02032; region of <italic>ACTB</italic> [<xref rid="B39-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. They noted the significantly increased expression of some ABPs: The &#x003b1;-actinin, myosin 2A, filamin A, and tropomyosin 4.2. Except for tropomyosin 4.2, the other proteins were recruited at a higher extent to F-actin bundles built by the mutant &#x003b2; actin and &#x003b1;-smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;-SMA) in patient-derived fibroblasts, compared to control cells. Other research showed that mouse myoblasts that overexpressed &#x003b2; actin also exhibited elevated levels of thymosin &#x003b2; and actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) [<xref rid="B43-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

The new, exquisite work from Antkowiak and his colleagues provides more details into this picture [<xref rid="B47-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. They showed that Arp2/3, profilin, Cap1/2, ADF/cofilin, and tropomyosin and their varying concentrations differently affected the balance between linear, formin-based, and Arp2/3 branched networks in both in vitro and in vivo models. The notion that the changes in the composition and dynamics of particular actin networks globally influence the pool of monomeric actin, and thus all F-actin structures present in the cell, was recently called &#x0201c;global treadmilling&#x0201d; by Carlier and Shekhar [<xref rid="B28-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In light of the data presented here, it seems interesting that in the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, the lamellipodial activity and Arp3 presence at the leading edge were diminished, while the formation of thick stress fiber bundles was prominently enhanced when compared to control and CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells. These observations are consistent with other studies that show that reduced activity of the Arp2/3 complex resulted in a disturbance in the formation of branched networks in favor of more extensive linear networks [<xref rid="B48-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="B50-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. </p><p>There are studies showing that &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin have different affinities in terms of interaction with ABPs. For instance M&#x000fc;ller with colleagues [<xref rid="B51-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] proved that &#x003b2; actin more strongly activates non-muscle myosin 2C1, while &#x003b3; actin preferentially activates myosin 7A. Dugina et al. [<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], on the other hand, by application of co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay, showed that &#x003b3; and not &#x003b2; actin associates with cofilin 1, PP1, WAVE2, and p34-Arc in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Thus it is plausible to expect that the action of ABPs on actin cytoskeleton could be dependent on &#x003b2;:&#x003b3; actin ratio. The issue of the capability of different isoactin monomers to copolymerize has been discussed for many years. Recently, it was shown by Bergeron and colleagues [<xref rid="B11-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin can copolymerize. Different &#x003b2;:&#x003b3; actin ratio in microfilament composition could determine the filament polymerization dynamics and ABPs&#x02019; interaction kinetics and finally availability of polymerizable pool of actin monomer. In consequence, this could be mirrored in the character and dynamics of F-actin structures and finally would determine the cell behavior. The observed in this study effects of <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> knock outs might be caused by either the lack of given actin isoform or the up-regulated level of the other one or by both. </p><p>The activity of Rho-GTPases regulates the formation of F-actin-based structures (lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fibers) and thus migration [<xref rid="B52-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Here, however, we do not see a clear correlation between Rho-GTPase activity upon LPA and PMA treatment and the F:G ratio or the formation of lamellipodia and stress fibers in the tested clones. We believe that the observed alterations in Rac1 and RhoA activity are a downstream effect of the altered actin network dynamics in the clones devoid of &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin due to two possible mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-02746-f010">Figure 10</xref>). In the case of CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells challenged with PMA, there was more N-WASP at the leading edges of the cells, which allowed more Arp2/3 to be activated and this resulted in better lamellipodial activity. As a result, this could eventually lead to higher Rac1 activity in comparison to control and CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells since, as discussed by Dang and Gautreau, lamellipodial activity might have a positive feedback loop on Rac1 activity [<xref rid="B53-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The downstream localization of Rac1 in the signaling cascade is further corroborated by the fact that the presence of WAVE-2, which is normally a downstream effector of Rac1 [<xref rid="B52-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], at the leading edge was unchanged under these conditions. On the other hand, in the LPA-treated CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones, there were as many mature FAs (&#x003b1;-parvin-rich) as there were in the CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells, but they were bigger. Moreover, there was a smaller number of nascent FAs (VASP-rich) in CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells than in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells. According to Wozniak and colleagues, Mena/VASP, together with Vinculin, act at nascent FAs (initial adhesions), whereas Src and FAK are recruited to adhesion sites later during the clustering of integrins [<xref rid="B54-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Alternatively, at nascent FAs, kindlin, together with the integrin-linked kinase (ILK):LIM and senescent cell antigen-like-containing domain protein (PINCH):parvin complex [<xref rid="B55-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and/or the migfilin:VASP complex [<xref rid="B56-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], associates with integrins at first and, following FAK and Src, associates with nascent FAs [<xref rid="B55-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Here, however, we observed &#x003b1;-parvin&#x02019;s presence at well-developed FAs. In accordance with the literature, FA formation activates RhoA [<xref rid="B57-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], but FA size may not determine the range of RhoA activation, but instead the ability to form new FAs. However, the diminished activity of RhoA in CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells might not be solely caused by the altered FA turnover. We also assume that the extent of stress fiber formation somehow influences RhoA activity in a negative feedback loop as the highest number of thickly bundled stress fibers and lowest RhoA activity, in comparison to control cells, were noted for CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells. We want to stress our belief that, at the core, the observed phenotypes are probably due to the different properties of actin isoforms in terms of their interactions with ABPs. Interestingly, we did not observe any changes in Cdc42 activity in response to LPA or PMA stimulation, though there is an interplay between Rho-GTPases [<xref rid="B58-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These would be in agreement with the notion that Rac1 and RhoA are mainly affected by the changes in dynamics of integrin-based structures [<xref rid="B59-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and here we observed disturbed FA formation/turnover.</p><p>We showed here that the studied actin isoforms have different effects on FA formation. Alterations in FA formation in cells lacking either &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin were accompanied by alterations in FA-associated signaling. Coherently with our findings, others noted that in the cells isolated from <italic>ACTB<sup>-/-</sup></italic>-mice, there were more stress fibers and FAs than in controls [<xref rid="B41-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B60-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. On the other hand, it was shown for HeLa cells that down-regulation of <italic>ACTB</italic> caused by the knockdown of the gene that encodes the RNA-binding protein HuR was accompanied by smaller numbers of stress fibers and impaired adhesion [<xref rid="B61-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Additionally, in contrast to our findings, Bunnell with colleagues observed that enhanced FA formation was positively correlated with impaired 2-D migration in mouse embryonic fibroblasts devoid of &#x003b2; actin [<xref rid="B41-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This could, however, be explained by the use of a different cellular model. Recently, we showed that A375 cells with lowered thymosin &#x003b2;4 expression exhibited a higher number of FAs and this was positively correlated with impaired 2-D and 3-D migration [<xref rid="B62-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is definitely worthwhile to continue to study the influence of actin isoforms on FA formation and composition as the integrins, receptors of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and key components of FAs, are being discussed as therapeutic targets in melanoma [<xref rid="B63-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] and interact with receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref rid="B52-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], like epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or hepatocyte growth factor receptor (c-MET), which play an important role in melanoma cells (discussed in [<xref rid="B64-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]). </p><p>Certainly, adhesion is crucial for anchorage-dependent cell motility [<xref rid="B52-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Because of that, we examined the motility of the tested clones. We showed earlier on mesenchymally and ameboidally moving cells [<xref rid="B65-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="B66-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] that &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actins have the same effect on the motility of the tested cell lines; however, our previous approach was based on isoactin overexpression and the endogenous presence of both isoactins in the cell could obscure the effect of overexpression. Here, in the wound-healing experiments, which mirror collective migration, we noted that CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells moved faster than control cells, whereas the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> clones closed the wound more slowly than CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> and control cells. These findings were in alignment with the observed lamellipodial activity of both types of clones upon PMA exposure. It was also previously shown that lowered &#x003b3; actin levels in neuroblastoma cells resulted in slower collective migration [<xref rid="B35-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, in terms of invasiveness, the lack of both isoactins had diminishing effects, although the clones formed an increased number of invadopodia and they were functional in terms of ECM digestion. We hypothesize that both isoactins have to be present in invadopodia, probably due to the structural features of filamentous actin or recruitment of appropriate ABPs, since our earlier studies showed that both &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin are present in active invadopodia [<xref rid="B67-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Our invasion results differ from those obtained by Dugina and colleagues [<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which showed that reduced &#x003b3; actin levels were accompanied by decreased invasion potential, but reduced &#x003b2; actin expression increased the invasion potential. This discrepancy can again be explained by different cellular models and, thus, divergent ABP landscapes and the fact that they used short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to down-regulate the expression of the given isoactin and here we had a complete knockout of non-muscle actin genes. Nevertheless, similarly to Dugina and colleagues [<xref rid="B34-ijms-21-02746" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we observed that &#x003b3; actin plays a more important role than &#x003b2; actin, at least in melanoma cells, in motility and adhesion. </p><p>We believe that with this study, we placed another brick in our understanding of the complex interaction between actin cytoskeleton components. We are deeply convinced that our results clearly indicate that both non-muscle actins play only partly redundant roles in melanoma cells&#x02019; adhesion and motility and that changes in the &#x003b2;:&#x003b3; actin ratio can reprogram a cell&#x02019;s fate; if the functions of &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; actin were exactly the same in melanoma cells, the lack of one of these non-muscle actins would be compensated for by elevations in the level of the other actin and thus result in restored cellular functions. Moreover, we were able to show that the expression level of each isoactin influences the expression of different sets of proteins. Having generated stable clones that were deprived of &#x003b2; or &#x003b3; actin, it is crucial to address several pivotal issues in future studies. One such issue is the influence of knockout of <italic>ACTB</italic> or <italic>ACTG1</italic> on the cell proliferation rate, signaling pathways involved in tumor progression, and nuclear processes regulated by actin. Alas, it is of high priority to design studies to analyze, in depth, the nature of the interactions between non-muscle actins and ABPs, such as the Arp2/3 complex, VASP, FHOD1, or Myosin IIA, as the differences between the ABPs could be at least partially responsible for the aforementioned effects. On that note, a thorough knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate melanoma cells&#x02019; motility would allow the design of new cancer therapies.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-ijms-21-02746"><title>4.

Supernatants were collected, while pellets were resuspended in actin depolymerization solution (10 &#x003bc;M cytochalasin D in water), and incubated for 1 h with occasional vortexing. Both fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. One-fifth of G-actin and F-actin fractions were loaded on lanes. Densitometric analysis was done as it is described in the Western blot analysis section. </p></sec><sec id="sec4dot13-ijms-21-02746"><title>4.13. Focal Adhesion and Cell Area Analysis</title><p>The number of focal adhesions for untreated, PMA-, or LPA-stimulated cells was counted manually using annotation tools of LasX application, according to immunostaining for &#x003b1;-parvin or VASP. The data are presented as a mean FAs&#x02019; number per cell. FAs&#x02019; and cell area were marked manually and measured automatically by using &#x0201c;Analyze &#x0003e; measure&#x0201d; command in ImageJ software (version 1.52p, F. Cordelieres, Institute Curie, Paris, France) (with previous scale settings). In the case of FAs&#x02019; number and cell area, 30 cells per group were analyzed. Then, area of FAs presents in nine cells chosen from earlier analyzed pool of cells were measured, which gave us the opportunity to observe the potential correlation between the number and size of FAs.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot14-ijms-21-02746"><title>4.14. Lamellipodium Width and Thickness Analysis</title><p>All analyses were done using the ZEISS LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and dedicated to this microscope software. The cells were seeded onto glass coverslips, treated with 100 nM PMA for 5 min, and stained with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor&#x02122; 488 and DNase I-Alexa Fluor&#x02122; 568. The images of immunofluorescent staining were analyzed within a clone by choosing approx. 10 cells per clone in different planes of sight. The width of lamellipodium was measured by guiding a histogram through the lamellipodium using a ruler in the software. The thickness of the lamellipodium was calculated by guiding a histogram through the lamellipodium and reading the whole intensity of fluorescence through the lamellipodium.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot15-ijms-21-02746"><title>4.15. Stress Fibers&#x02019; Formation Analysis</title><p>The analysis was done using the ZEISS LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and dedicated to this microscope software. The cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and, after 24 h, treated with 1 &#x003bc;M LPA for 10 min. Staining and choosing of cells for analysis was done as described in the paragraph above. The number of thickly bundled stress fibers per cell was assessed by guiding a histogram through the width of the cell containing thick stress fibers and identifying the number of fluorescent values that were higher or equal to 75% of the highest fluorescence peak.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot16-ijms-21-02746"><title>4.16. Gelatin Digestion Assay </title><p>The assay was conducted in order to assess the number of active invadopodia in the cells. Poly-L-lysine coated coverslips (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) placed in a 24-well plate were rinsed with 1xPBS. Then the coverslips were fixed by incubation with 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT), followed by another washing with PBS. The coverslips were then inverted onto a drop of fluorescein-conjugated gelatin solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland) and incubated in the dark for 10 min at RT. After that, the coverslips were again inverted with the gelatin-coated side up and the residual reactive groups were quenched by adding 5 mg/mL sodium borohydride and 1 min incubation at RT, followed by washing with PBS. Before seeding the cells, the coverslips were rinsed with warm cell culture medium. The cells were seeded at the density of 30,000 per coverslip in a 24-well plate in full cell culture medium and kept at 37 &#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 12 h before fixing with 4% FA. The cells were stained using phalloidin-Alexa Fluor&#x02122; 568 and Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Warsaw, Poland) to detect F-actin and cell nuclei, respectively. The images were obtained by using confocal microscopy. The number of invadopodia and the area of gelatin digestion was estimated by using the ImageJ software (version 1.52p, F. Cordelieres, Institute Curie, Paris, France). A total number of 10 cells per clone were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot17-ijms-21-02746"><title>4.17. Statistical Analysis</title><p>For each analysis, groups consisting of 3 clones (three biological replicates) were analyzed. Statistical analysis and graphs were performed with the use of GraphPad Prism 7 and 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Normality distribution was analyzed with Shapiro&#x02013;Wilks and D&#x02019;Agostino&#x02013;Pearson normality tests. Statistical significances of analyzed data were determined using the parametric or nonparametric versions of unpaired student&#x02019;s t-test or ANOVA (one-way or two-way) tests, properly to obtained data set. The significance levels were set at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 (*), <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 (**), <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 (***), and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 (****).

Cells devoid of &#x003b2; actin that grew in full medium exhibited more nascent (VASP-rich) focal adhesions (nFAs) and mature (VASP- and &#x003b1;-parvin-rich) focal adhesions (FAs) than did CR-CTRL cells. Although the CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> and CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells possess more mature FAs under the same conditions than control cells, FAs of CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells are smaller. Moreover, CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells have many more nascent FAs than both control and CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells. Alterations in FA dynamics, stress fiber formation, and the distribution of some ABPs at the leading edge results in changes in Rac1 activation, improved 2-D migration, and impaired invasion in CR-<italic>ACTB</italic> cells. In the case of CR-<italic>ACTG1</italic> cells, the impaired FA turnover, increased number of thick stress fibers, and decreased level of Arp3 at the leading edge led to lowered activation status of RhoA and finally to impeded 2-D and 3-D migration. For details, please see the discussion. In summary, the lack of &#x003b3; actin has more severe effects on melanoma cells than the lack of &#x003b2; actin. We believe that changes in the formation/turnover of FAs might be caused by the different properties of non-muscle actins&#x02019; interactions with ABPs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijms-21-02746-g010"/></fig></floats-group></article>
