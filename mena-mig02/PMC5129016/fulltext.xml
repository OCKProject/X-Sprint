How the triple cell complex composed of a macrophage, Mena over-expressing tumor cell and endothelial cell, called the tumor microenvironment of metastasis (TMEM), facilitates tumor cell transendothelial migration is not completely understood. Previous work has shown that the physical contact between a macrophage and tumor cell results in the formation of invadopodia, actin-rich matrix degrading protrusions, important for tumor cell invasion and transendothelial migration and tumor cell dissemination. Herein, we show that the macrophage-induced invadopodium is formed through a Notch1/Mena<sup>INV</sup> signaling pathway in the tumor cell upon macrophage contact. This heterotypic tumor cell &#x02013; macrophage interaction results in the upregulation of Mena<sup>INV</sup> through the activation of MENA transcription. Notch1 and Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression are required for tumor cell transendothelial migration, a necessary step during intravasation. Inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway blocked macrophage-induced invadopodium formation <italic>in vitro</italic> and the dissemination of tumor cells from the primary tumor <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our findings indicate a novel role for Notch1 signaling in the regulation of Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression and transendothelial migration and provide mechanistic information essential to the use of therapeutic inhibitors of metastasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Metastasis is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality of breast cancer patients. The process of breast cancer metastasis requires tumor cells to migrate towards blood vessels where they intravasate. Intravasation of tumor cells during metastasis remains poorly understood, although it has become increasingly apparent that components of the tumor microenvironment such as macrophages, contribute to the efficacy of this process. Within invasive breast carcinoma we have identified multicellular microanatomical structures called the tumor microenvironment of metastasis (TMEM) that serve as the functional sites of tumor cell intravasation, and have been validated as a prognostic marker of metastatic outcome in patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Each TMEM site is comprised of a Mena over-expressing tumor cell, a peri-vascular macrophage and an endothelial cell of a blood vessel in direct contact with each other. It is at these sites that transient vascular- permeability events and intravasation of breast tumor cells uniquely occur in breast tumors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The importance of the direct contact of these three cell types and signaling between these cells during the function of TMEM in intravasation has not yet been explored.</p><p>Migratory and disseminating breast tumor cells at TMEM over-express the ENA/Vasp family member Mena (mammalian-ENA) when compared to normal breast epithelium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Overexpression of Mena, an actin regulatory protein, is also seen in other cancers of epithelial origin including pancreatic, lung, cervical and colon cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Mena is alternatively spliced during tumor progression resulting in the expression of multiple isoforms encoded by the same gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The expression of the different isoforms is associated with various cell phenotypes. Predominate expression of the Mena11a isoform confers an epithelial, cohesive, non-invasive cell behavior; while the over-expression of Mena<sup>INV</sup> results in a highly motile, invasive phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>The number of TMEM sites in patient samples positively correlates with the abundance of Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA, whereas Mena11a demonstrates a negative correlation in the same patient cohort<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Previous work has demonstrated that the expression of the Mena11a isoform is regulated by Twist signaling<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, but despite the numerous studies indicating the over-expression of Mena<sup>INV</sup> in invasive-intravasation-competent tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, the signals regulating the expression of the Mena<sup>INV</sup> isoform have remained unknown.</p><p>In addition to the macrophage-regulated vascular permeability events that contribute to tumor cell intravasation and metastasis, tumor cells form an invasive actin-rich invadopodium that enables the tumor cell to degrade extra-cellular matrix proteins and migrate, invading across barriers like blood vessel walls and intravasate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Invadopodia are required for tumor cell transendothelial migration, a necessary step for intravasation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Although it has been generally appreciated that invadopodia are important for tumor cell migration and intravasation it is not completely understood how<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. There is evidence in multiple <italic>in vivo</italic> models such as chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) models, tumor xenographs in mice and zebrafish and transgenic mouse models that invadopodia can be observed in mammalian cells <italic>in vivo</italic> and that these structures play a critical role in the cells ability to breech the basement membrane for invasion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In addition, the depletion of critical invadopodial components <italic>in vivo</italic> reduces the numbers of circulating tumor cells and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Interestingly, we have previously shown that the direct interaction of a tumor cell and macrophage results in the formation of the tumor cell invadopodium that is required for transendothelial migration of tumor cells and this cannot be mimicked with macrophage-conditioned medium<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Therefore, a direct contact event between tumor cells and macrophages results in a signal inducing the formation of invadopodia.</p><p>A major signaling pathway that is involved in cell contact-mediated communication is the Notch signaling pathway. In addition to critical roles in development, Notch signaling has been implicated in cancers such as breast, lung and pancreatic cancers and leukemia, where activation of Notch pathways can promote proliferation, prevent differentiation, and promote metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Disruption of the Notch signaling pathways can affect cell growth, cell fate, angiogenesis and apoptosis. In tumor cells, activation of Notch upon homotypic cell contact triggers invadopodium formation under hypoxia conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>.</p><p>Herein, we explore the contribution of the Notch signaling pathway to TMEM function; in particular macrophage-dependent tumor cell invadopodium formation and its relationship to Mena expression during transendothelial migration and tumor cell dissemination.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Notch1 signaling is required for macrophage-induced formation of invadopodia in tumor cells</title><p>To evaluate if Notch signaling is required for macrophage &#x02013; induced invadopodium formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A</xref>), cells were treated with DAPT, a &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor, which inhibits intracellular Notch signaling by preventing its cleavage into the active NICD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. A mature invadopodium is defined herein as having cortactin and Tks5 positive staining as well as being co-localized with a discreet area of matrix degradation. Tks5 is required for anchoring the invadopodium core to the plasma membrane via its binding to PI (3, 4) P2<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and its association with these other two markers is a definitive identifier of mature invadopodia. In the absence of macrophages and in serum-starved conditions, DAPT treatment has no significant effect on invadopodium assembly by MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>). When BAC1.2F5 macrophages are added to the MDA-MB-231 culture there is a significant increase in the number of mature invadopodia per tumor cell but the addition of DAPT to these co-cultures prevents the macrophage-mediated induction of invadopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p>Increased Notch1 signaling is associated with a greater chance of metastasis and poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Therefore, to determine if Notch1 receptor is important in macrophage&#x02013;induced invadopodium formation we used siRNA mediated knockdown of Notch1. Knockdown of Notch1 receptor in MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in a significant reduction in macrophage-induced invadopodia as well as a significant reduction in invadopodium-associated matrix degradation to baseline levels seen in the absence of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1C&#x02013;E</xref>). Notch1 inhibition had no significant effect on steady sate invadopodium formation in the absence of macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure 1A and B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that Notch1 is required for macrophage-induced invadopodium assembly and function. These data indicate a novel signaling pathway involving heterotypic cell-cell communication of Notch1 in macrophage-induced invadopodium formation in tumor cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Notch1 signaling is required for macrophage &#x02013; tumor cell contact-induced Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression</title><p>Notch1 has well defined roles in the regulation of gene and protein expression at the transcriptional level, although a role for Notch1 in the regulation of the macrophage-induced invadopodium pathway is unknown. We sought to determine if macrophage &#x02013; induced Notch1 signaling in tumor cells results in expression changes in genes with known roles in invadopodium formation and function. We performed a qRT-PCR analysis to determine changes in mRNA levels of the known invadopodium pathway regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The co-culture of MDA-MB-231 tumor cells with macrophages resulted in no significant mRNA changes in actin, cortactin, cofilin, N-WASp or the RhoGTPases Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA and RhoC, which all have well defined roles in invadopodia regulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. There was no significant change in the level of total (pan) Mena mRNA levels which are very abundant compared to Mena<sup>INV</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure 2B</xref>), but the Mena<sup>INV</sup> isoform was highly upregulated (~45x) while Mena11a isoform levels remain unchanged. This finding is of great interest because high expression of the Mena<sup>INV</sup> isoform has been implicated in the increased motility, invadopodium assembly and invasion by tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>.</p><p>There is a well described paracrine signaling loop between human breast or mouse mammary tumor cells and macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Due to this well-defined soluble signaling pathway between tumor cells and macrophages, we wanted to confirm that the increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> upon co-culture with macrophages was a result of cell-cell contact and not soluble signaling factors. We performed co-culture experiments utilizing 3&#x02009;&#x003bc;m pore transwells, which allow for the passage of soluble factors but not the tumor cells. Tumor cells were either plated in the transwell alone, with the two cell types mixed in the top of the well, or with macrophages added to the bottom of the well to prevent tumor cell &#x02013; macrophage contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2B</xref>). When the cell types were mixed together in the top of the transwell, allowing cell-cell contact, we observed the increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA whereas when the cells were plated on opposite sides of the transwell, allowing for the exchange of soluble factors but not direct contact, no significant change in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA was observed.</p><p>To confirm that the increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA is regulated by the macrophage-tumor cell contact initiated Notch1 signaling, we treated the tumor cells with Notch1 siRNA or DAPT. We found that both had the ability to abrogate the increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA during co-culture of the two cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C and D</xref>).</p><p>To determine if these events are macrophage-contact specific, we co-cultured tumor cells at high density to induce tumor cell-tumor cell contact, tumor cell and macrophage contact or tumor cells and endothelial cell contact. These are the three different cell types that comprise TMEM sites. The only contact that was able to induce an increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression was the tumor cell and macrophage co-culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, the contact between tumor cells and HUVEC endothelial cells did not result in an increase in mature invadopodia or matrix degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the MDA-MB-231 cells, we confirmed the macrophage-induced expression of Mena<sup>INV</sup> in primary tumor cells. Tumor cells were obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA), which yields ~97% pure tumor cell samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Cells obtained by FNA from triple negative human tumor tissue transplants (HT17)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> were plated with or without macrophages for 6&#x02009;hours. Although a subset of tumor cells <italic>in vivo</italic> express elevated Mena<sup>INV</sup>, when cells were cultured with macrophages there is a significant increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>). When cells are plated with macrophages in the presence of DAPT there was an inhibition of Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3A</xref>), indicating a requirment for Notch signaling in primary tumor cells.</p><p>Primary cancer cells were also obtained by FNA from two human invasive ductal carcinomas immediately after surgical resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>, patient #1 had ER+ disease and patient #2 had ER- disease). In cells from these 2 patient samples we also observed a dramatic increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA when co-cultured with macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3B</xref>). These data indicate a novel pathway for the upregulation of the pro-migratory/invasive Mena<sup>INV</sup> isoform of Mena that is common to breast cancer cells with different ER expression status.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Macrophage &#x02013; tumor cell contact turns on Notch-dependent MENA gene transcription and Mena<sup>INV</sup> protein expression</title><p>The above results indicate that a Mena isoform switch is taking place upon macrophage contact because the panMena and Mena11a mRNA levels remained unchanged while Mena<sup>INV</sup> levels increase dramatically. This expression switch of isoforms presumably requires the transcription of the MENA gene, where the newly transcribed RNA would be spliced to include the Mena<sup>INV</sup> exon.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that the increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA seen in tumor cells in contact with macrophages is associated with increased Mena gene transcription, we designed fluorescent <italic>in-situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) probes to MENA. The different Mena isoforms are splice variants transcribed by the same gene<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>; therefore the probes designed recognize the full length MENA gene transcript (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). Macrophages were labeled with cell tracker red and co-cultured with tumor cells for 60&#x02009;minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A</xref>). When MDA-MB-231 tumor cells are cultured alone, only ~10% have an active MENA transcription site, as seen by FISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4B</xref>). When tumor cells and macrophages are plated in co-culture for 1&#x02009;hour, tumor cells that are not in contact with macrophages still only display ~10% of cells actively transcribing MENA, while tumor cells touching a macrophage have over 45% of cells with active transcription sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4A and B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref> shows a tumor cell in direct contact with a macrophage displaying active MENA transcription, and a tumor cell not in contact with a macrophage displaying no active MENA transcription site. The addition of DAPT to the tumor cell-macrophage co-culture prevented the macrophage induction of MENA transcription, even when the tumor cells were in direct contact with macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we measured the probability of active MENA transcription as a function of the distance of a tumor cell to the nearest macrophage in control conditions or in the presence of DAPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4D and E</xref>). When tumor cells are touching macrophages (0&#x02009;&#x003bc;m distance), the probability of active MENA transcription is ~0.65, a high probability of transcription. As the distance becomes greater than 35&#x02009;&#x003bc;m away, there is zero probability that the tumor cell has an active MENA transcription site. In the presence of DAPT treatment, tumor cells show a scattered pattern of low level transcription versus distance from a macrophage indicating that by blocking Notch signaling we have inhibited the macrophage contact induced MENA transcription.</p><p>These FISH data and the qPCR data above indicate that when tumor cells come into direct contact with a macrophage there is a rapid Notch-dependent induction of MENA transcription.</p><p>To determine if the macrophage activation of MENA transcription and the increased accumulation of Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA results in increased Mena<sup>INV</sup> protein in the tumor cells, we developed a polyclonal anti- Mena<sup>INV</sup> specific antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cells plated alone or in co-culture with macrophages for 16&#x02009;hours were stained using the newly developed Mena<sup>INV</sup>-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The average intensity was measured with Mena<sup>INV</sup> staining in tumor cells alone or those cultured with macrophages. When cultured with macrophages, tumor cells show a significant increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> protein staining intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5</xref>). This data indicates that the Notch-mediated increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> mRNA observed in tumor cells in contact with macrophages is translated into an increase in Mena<sup>INV</sup> protein levels in the tumor cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mena<sup>INV</sup> and Notch1 are required for invadopodium-driven transendothelial migration</title><p>The above results demonstrate that macrophage &#x02013; induced tumor cell invadopodium formation requires Notch1 signaling.

Therefore, we hypothesized that Notch1 and Mena<sup>INV</sup> are both required for the formation of the invadopodia necessary for tumor cells to undergo transendothelial migration.</p><p>Specific knockdown of Mena<sup>INV</sup> significantly reduces the number of mature invadopodia formed upon macrophage-tumor cell contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Knockdown of panMena results in the knockdown off all Mena isoforms, therefore also depleting Mena<sup>INV</sup>. Interestingly, depletion of total Mena has no additive effect over the Mena<sup>INV</sup> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). Therefore, Mena<sup>INV</sup> is the key isoform that regulates macrophage-induced invadopodia.</p><p>To determine the role of Notch1 in tumor cell intravasation-directed transendothelial migration (iTEM) activity, we either depleted Notch1 in tumor cells with siRNA or inhibited Notch signaling with DAPT and quantified the tumor cell iTEM activity in the presence and absence of macrophages.

As an additional method of inhibiting Notch1 signaling applicable to the MTLn3 cells, we treated MTLn3 cells with a Notch1 specific blocking antibody or control isotype IgG. Cells co-cultured with macrophages and treated with the Notch1 blocking antibody demonstrate significantly fewer invadopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7A</xref> and B). These data demonstrate that the macrophage-induced invadopodia can be stimulated in a different well-characterized invasive and metastatic tumor cell line and this is Notch1 dependent.</p><p>We utilized MTLn3 cells expressing photo-convertible Dendra2 to measure the effects of Notch1 inhibition on loss of tumor cells from the primary tumor <italic>in vivo</italic> as described previously<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>.

In this study we define the molecular mechanism by which the direct contact between macrophages and tumor cells leads to invadopodium formation and transendothelial migration. We show that these events require the Notch1 receptor on the tumor cell and that Notch1 signaling induces Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression via activation of transcription. We found that Notch1 is required for transendothelial migration of tumor cells and dissemination of tumor cells from the primary tumor. These results are consistent with previous work showing that Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression is required for transendothelial migration by tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, that the knockdown of Mena<sup>INV</sup> inhibits macrophage-mediated transendothelial migration of tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> and, conversely, that Mena<sup>INV</sup> over-expression drives invadopodium assembly and function, and transendothelial migration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>The relative expression of Mena<sup>INV</sup> to that of Mena11a is associated with TMEM assembly, metastatic recurrence and death of breast cancer patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>.

Another study demonstrated involvement of endosialin-expressing pericytes in cancer cell transendothelial migration and dissemination<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Endothelial cells are also actively involved in regulation of cancer cell dissemination. The interaction of CXCR12 (SDF-1), secreted by endothelial cells, with tumor cell expressed CXCR4 is sufficient to stimulate transendothelial migration of the tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Interestingly, the induction of SDF-1 in endothelial cells seems to be mediated by hypoxia. CXCL12 (SDF-1) can also be expressed by tumor cells and it results in increased macrophage and microvessel density and <italic>in vivo</italic> invasiveness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.

The molecular characterization of the Notch1 - dependent Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression shown here opens the possibility of developing additional markers that might be used in combination with TMEM sites to better predict the risk of distant metastatic recurrence of breast cancer patients and their response to treatment. We think that combining measures of Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression with the presence of TMEM sites could be useful in determining the relative activity of TMEM sites in transendothelial migration and the response to inhibitors designed to suppress either Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression and/or TMEM activity.

However, the mechanisms regulating Mena<sup>INV</sup> have remained unknown until now. Our finding of the increased expression of Mena<sup>INV</sup> in response to Notch1 signaling between tumor cells and macrophages, but not between tumor cells and endothelial cells, restricts the origin of Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression in the TMEM tumor cell, and therefore invadopodium assembly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>, to the macrophage-tumor cell interaction. This leaves open the question about the myeloid cell type specificity of the induction of Mena<sup>INV</sup> expression and invadopodia in tumor cells. In this regard neutrophils have been tested for their ability to induce invadopodia and transendothelial migration in a previous study and fail to do either<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Of relevance to the macrophage subtypes involved in tumor cell invasion and intravasation, the myeloid cells associated with tumor cells in mammary tumors during invasive migration resulting in intravasation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> are CD11b positive (a classical myeloid lineage marker) and GR1 negative (neutrophil marker) further excluding neutrophils from association with these particular tumor cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>. Furthermore, the CD11b positive tumor cell associated myeloid cells have been expression profiled to determine their identity as invasive macrophages<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>.
