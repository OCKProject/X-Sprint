Additionally, by inhibiting specific signaling paths, such as PI3K, PPAR&#x003b3; and FAK pathways, we established a correlation between their regulation and the presence of new histone PTMs. Our results may provide new insight on the possible implication of these modifications in breast cancer and may offer new perspectives for future clinical applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>2D TAU gel</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>FAK</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotic cells, DNA is packaged into chromatin. The level of compaction derives from the degree of DNA winding around nucleosomes [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Each nucleosome consists of 147bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer core containing one histone H3&#x02013;H4 tetramer and two histone H2A-H2B dimers. Histones are very basic proteins highly conserved throughout evolution, organized in three domains: the hydrophobic central globular domain that interacts with DNA, and the very basic unstructured C- and N-terminal tails [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tails protrude away from the nucleosome and are frequently subjected to post-translational modifications (PTMs). In addition to histones of the core particle, the linker histone H1 binds the DNA on the surface of the nucleosomal core and completes the nucleosome. The histone linker is required to stabilize the highly ordered chromatin structure [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The action of H1 histone influences the nucleosomal repeat length (NRL), thereby modulating the accessibility of chromatin for transcription [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The degree of packaging of chromatin is highly influenced by numerous factors, including histone PTMs [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Enzymes called <italic>writers</italic> and <italic>erasers</italic> add and remove PTMs from histones, affecting inter/intra-nucleosomal interactions and their binding to DNA. In addition, histone readers specifically bind certain PTMs, resulting in specific responses at the level of transcription, DNA repair and replication [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Histones and histone-variants represent a key class of proteins able to trigger the encoding of epigenetic information as well as the regulation of gene expression [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Histone PTMs profiles (histone code) are known to be altered in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, the most frequent neoplasia among women. Specific histone PTMs are associated with breast cancer development and prognosis, such as H3K9ac, H3K9me2-3, H4K16ac and H4K20me3 [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A plethora of studies suggests a pivotal role of histone modifications in the onset as well as in the progression of breast cancer. Therefore, profiling and characterization of histone isoforms and their PTMs may contribute to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying breast tumorigenesis. Moreover, the role of epigenetics in sporadic as well as in hereditary breast cancer needs to be deepened in order to provide novel targets for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches.</p><p>In this work, we applied 2D-TAU/SDS gel electrophoresis coupled to LC-MS/MS analysis to identify and characterize histone PTMs profiles in normal mammary epithelial cell line MCF10 and in two distinct breast cancer cell lines: MCF7 (sporadic breastcancer model) and HCC1937 (BRCA1<sup>-/-</sup> hereditary breast cancer model) [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Seventeen novel histone marks were identified. In addition, 2D-TAU Western blot analysis was applied to differentially profile the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern in all cell lines</p><p>The most striking result is the identification of a tyrosine phosphorylation on the histone H1, that increases in breast cancer cells and correlates with the proliferative status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such a finding.</p><p>Ultimately, we identify additional putative cancer-related histone marks, we reveal quantitative differences of PTMs in different cellular models of breast cancer and, suggesting a pivotal role of these modifications in proliferation, we provide a substantial input for further investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>2D TAU gel of histone PTMs in breast cell lines</title><p>Histones were isolated from mammalian cell lines and proteins content was determined using Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions with human serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich) as standard. Twenty &#x003bc;g of each sample were loaded on a 1D TAU-gel to assess the efficiency of the isolation methods. The gel, relative to the separation of histones is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>. As expected, the separation pattern of histone isoforms was found coherent with previous literature [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>1D TAU gel and 2D TAU gel map of histones in breast cancer cells.</bold> (Panel <bold>A</bold>) The image shows a peculiar separation pattern of histone isoforms, extract from HCC1937, MCF7 and MCF10 cells lines, using 1D-TAU gel.

Recently, attention focused on epigenetic phenomena and their association with cancer. Moreover, unlike genetic alterations, epigenetic changes are a reversible phenomenon and therefore potentially druggable [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In addition to DNA methylation, histone PTMs are main actors in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. By acting individually or in combination, histone marks modulate the transcriptional state of chromatin and by assembling and disassembling nucleosomes allow or not the binding of transcription factors and ultimately, the building up of the transcriptional machinery.</p><p>There are several histone PTMs, with specific biological and pathophysiological implications, whose altered expression has been associated with cancer. Conversely, many other PTMs have roles still unknown.</p><p>In our work, we investigated the pattern of histone PTMs in normal and breast cancer cell lines by 2D TAU electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry.</p><p>The comprehensive analysis of the unmapped PTMs was performed by two-dimensional Western blotting using anti-Y-phospho antibody.</p><p>The pattern of PTMs of canonical histones and their variants allowed us to evaluate and to identify differentially expressed isoforms among the three breast cell types used. Particularly, by overlapping immunoblotting results with mass spectrometry data, we found peculiar tyrosine phosphorylations at residues Y74 of histone H1.5; at Y70 in H1.2 and at Y71 in H1.3.</p><p>Our data clearly demonstrate that levels of H1 tyrosine phosphorylation are much higher in both the analyzed breast cancer cells (MCF7 and HCC1937) compared to the immortalized normal epithelial cell line MCF10. By modulating mitogenic pathways, we established a correlation between H1 tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferative status, enforcing the notion of a role of phosphorylated histones in the definition of the tumor phenotype. We give evidence that EGF treatment was able to induce a significant increase of tyrosine phosphorylation in H1, much more evident in MCF7 cells than in MCF10 cells. Next, we analyzed the effects that modulation of three signaling pathways, known to be altered in cancerogenesis, PI3K, PPAR&#x003b3; and FAK, could have on phosphorylation in H1.</p><p>Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream mediator AKT are activated in many types of cancer and regulate many processes including proliferation, migration, apoptosis, differentiation and cell adhesion [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our data disclosed that the treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, leads to a 50% reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation in H1 in both tumor cell types, suggesting that the kinase regulating this phosphorylation must be a downstream effector of PI3K signaling.</p><p>Furthermore, we treated tumor cells with Troglitazone, a PPAR&#x003b3; agonist whose anti-tumor properties in breast cancer have been extensively reported [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Troglitazone belongs to Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) antidiabetic drugs and has antiproliferative effects [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] by both receptor dependent and independent actions. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) is a member of nuclear ligand-dependent transcription factor whose activation leads to growth inhibition in human breast cancer cells. Activation of PPAR&#x003b3; controls cell migration by upregulating the expression of PTEN, that leads, in turn, to a decrease of FAK and paxillin phosphorylation [<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, treatment with Troglitazone induces a significant reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation levels on histone H1.</p><p>These results, together with the search of phosphorylation consensus, allowed us to focus the attention on Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), as a candidate for the H1 tyrosine phosphorylation. FAK is an evolutionarily conserved non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays important roles in specific cellular functions such as adhesion, migration, invasion, polarity, proliferation and survival [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The auto-phosphorylation of FAK at Y397 is the first step for its activation and creates a binding site for Src. Thus, Src phosphorylates several sites of FAK, including the tyrosine 576 and 577 within the central kinase domain and positively regulates FAK kinase activity. AKT associates with FAK and directly modulates its expression through phosphorylation at several serine and threonine residues [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. FAK is overexpressed in several cancers; specifically, high levels of FAK were found in breast cancer tissues and correlate with cancer progression and lymph node positivity [<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Under normal conditions, FAK is typically a cytoplasmic kinase, but it can shuttle into the nucleus under appropriate stimuli in several cell types [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the nuclei, FAK promotes p53 ubiquitination, acting as a scaffold [<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, FAK has a role in histone PTMs promoting H3K27me3 through the regulation of zeste homolog 2 enhancer (EZH2) [<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nuclear FAK is associated with chromatin in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and interacts with a number of transcription factors and regulators [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], interfering with GATA4 transcription factor and controlling chromatin structure [<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Treatment with PND1186, a selective FAK inhibitor, induces in our cell systems a significant reduction of H1 tyrosine phosphorylation, detectable very early, as expected if FAK directly acts on the substrate.</p><p>The ability of FAK to directly interact with the histone H1 was supported by their co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization during the interphase of cell cycle assessed immunofluorescence analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, this work offers a robust method for a comprehensive cover of PTMs occurring in histones in normal, sporadic and hereditary breast cancer cell lines. It proposes H1 tyrosine phosphorylation as novel PTM with a potential, relevant role in breast tumorigenesis and it candidates FAK as the kinase probably involved in H1 phosphorylation suggesting a novel key role of FAK in controlling post-translational events relevant in breast cancer proliferation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Human breast cancer cell line MCF7 (ATCC, Manassas, USA) was grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma Aldrich), 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100U/ml penicillin (Sigma Aldrich).

Immunocomplexes were resolved on 4-20% SDS gel, blotted using a Trans-blot turbo system (Biorad) for 30 minutes at 30V, 1.0A and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using the following antibodies: pFAK (Tyr397) (1:200; D20B1), FAK (D2R2E, Cell signaling)(1:1000) and H1 (1:100; Abcam ab71594).</p><p>The assays were repeated in three independent biological replicates. Whole and nuclear extract (100 &#x003bc;g each) were resolved by pre cast SDS-PAGE (Any kD&#x02122; Mini-PROTEAN Precast Protein Gels, Biorad) and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with a Trans-blot turbo system (Biorad). Membranes were incubated using the following primary antibodies: FAK (D2R2E, Cell signaling)(1:1000), Vimentin (5741, Cell signaling, 1:1000). The detection of a primary antibody was done with antirabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugate secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling). Blots were developed using the SuperSignal West Femto ECL substrate (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany). Images were acquired using Alliance 2.7 (UVITEC, Eppendorf, Milan, Italy)</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. After permeabilization with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min, the cells were blocked with 10% FBS (Biowest) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with H1 (1:100, Abcam ab71594) and FAK (1:100, Cell Signaling, 3285) primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3% FBS. Goat anti-mouse Alexa-Fluor-647 (A-21235, Life Technologies) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa-Fluor-488 (A-11008, Life Technologies) were used as the secondary antibodies at a concentration of 2 &#x003bc;g/ml in PBS containing 1% FBS for 45 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Slides were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako Cytomation) and images were acquired with DMi8 Leica microscope. The assays were repeated in three independent biological replicates</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="aging-11-102577-s001..pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1580" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS:</bold> DS and GC conceived and designed the experiments; AMP performed gel TAU experiments and proteomics analysis.
