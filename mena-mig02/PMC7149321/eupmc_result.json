    "Countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region share important sociocultural features but also differ significantly on a number of dimensions, including methods and approaches to addressing the health of their national populations. This article is a systematic analysis of the health systems of the region, including a review of health patterns and services to address them. A number of health systems dimensions are discussed, including the organization of biomedical and traditional medical services, access to health services, financing and resourcing mechanisms, and leadership and governance issues. Current and future challenges that need to be addressed by countries to ensure more efficient and responsive systems are also reviewed."
