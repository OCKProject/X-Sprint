For this reason, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) based therapies are used in regenerative medicine for treating several clinical conditions including ulcers, burns, muscle damage, bone diseases and in tissue recovery after surgery (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Etulain, 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anitua et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the large variability of applications, the efficacy of regenerative treatments using PRP has been called into question due to the absence of large controlled clinical trials and consensus regarding PRP preparation techniques. The procedures currently used for this purpose are derived from classical protocols for obtaining platelet concentrates for transfusion, coagulation assays or platelet functionality, which are focused on preserving platelet hemostatic responses (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Etulain et al., 2018</xref>). Most of these protocols use citrate as a common element in anticoagulant-conservative solutions. Citrate-based anticoagulants prevent coagulation by their ability to chelate ionized calcium present in the blood to form non-ionized calcium-citrate complexes (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mariano et al., 2011</xref>). This allows to preserved the hemostatic functionality of platelets for long periods of time (5&#x02013;7 days) and it is also safe and efficient for transfusions since citrate is diluted in volemia and rapidly metabolized to bicarbonate by the tricarboxylic pathway in liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Leparc, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Mariano et al., 2011</xref>). Based on these classical settings, acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD) and sodium citrate (SC) solutions are commonly used for collecting blood in the context of regenerative protocols mediated by platelets (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">The International Cellular Medical Society, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Dhurat and Sukesh, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Anitua et al., 2016</xref>). The studies about the effect of anticoagulants in the context of regenerative treatments with platelets are only focused on optimizing platelets number, coagulation or platelet-derived growth factors levels (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Neill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Giraldo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">do Amaral et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Singh, 2018</xref>) but they do not analyze the functionality of platelets on target tissue neither the possible adverse consequences caused by anticoagulants additives in platelet solutions. Notably, adverse effects have been reported in patients in the context of tendinopathies treatments with PRP including swelling, erythema, edema, and pain (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kaux et al., 2014</xref>); skin redness, swelling, bruising, pruritus, scaling, and dryness after intra-dermal injection of PRP in the context of skin rejuvenation (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alam et al., 2018</xref>); and the systemic allergic reaction post-injection of PRP into a bone cyst (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Latalski et al., 2019</xref>). Although the potential mediators/mechanisms involved in these effects were not addressed, one of these studies revealed the intradermal allergic reaction against citrate during skin allergic test (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Latalski et al., 2019</xref>) suggesting a possible toxic effect caused by the anticoagulant additive in PRP. To further understand the local effect of citrate on tissue regeneration we evaluated the effect of ACD and SC analyzing their effect on the target phenomena of angiogenesis and regeneration mediated by platelets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Ethics Statements</title><p>Human blood studies were conducted according with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Ethic Committee of the National Academy of Medicine (T.I. 12910/18/X).

To this purpose, PRP was obtained from blood samples anticoagulated with either SC or ACD; platelets were lysed; coagulation was activated or not by CaCl<sub>2</sub> addition and supernatants (containing the platelet releasates, PRPr) were used as inducers of HMEC-1 proliferation and migration, both responses required during angiogenesis. Platelet poor plasma (PPP) was used as control. In contrast with the isolated and attached morphology of cells observed before treatments, incubation of HMEC-1 for 24 h with PPP or PRPr without addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in the aggrupation of cells in clusters and no cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Normal cobblestone endothelial cell morphology was observed by treatment of HMEC-1 after calcium restitution confirming the crucial role of this cation in cellular adhesion and morphology. Moreover, cell proliferation from the original number of 15 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>cells (dotted line) was triggered by PRPr, being that induced by SC-PRPr higher than ACD- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to the proliferation results, cell migration was not observed in cells exposed to PPP although the angiogenic response was triggered by SC-PRPr but not ACD- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, alteration of cellular morphology evidenced as disruption and density changes of confluent monolayer limiting wounds was observed after experimental conditions without CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Analysis of cellular viability showed that 15 and 20% of HMEC-1 death was detected after 24 h of incubation with SC-PRPr and ACD- without CaCl<sub>2</sub>, respectively (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Levels of cellular death were reduced after restitution of CaCl<sub>2</sub> without showing significant differences between SC-PRPr and ACD- treatments (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results suggest that decrease of angiogenic responses observed in non-calcium conditions could be partially explained by endothelial death. In contrast, differences in cell proliferation and migration between SC-PRPr and ACD- were not associated to a differential induction of cellular death (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) neither to a differential recovery in platelet number or levels of growth factors on PRPr (VEGF, PDGF, EGF, bFGF, and TGF&#x003b2;) (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). To rule out that results were associated with the use of an immortalized cell line, the experiments were repeated using a primary cell culture of HUVEC. Proliferation and migration of endothelial cells was again only induced after calcium restitution, being that induced by SC-PRPr higher than ACD- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1C,D</xref>). Similar results were also observed in the treatments containing a commercial growth factors-enriched medium (EGM2) instead PRPr indicating that the effect exerted by anticoagulants is extended to different types of endothelial cells and culture media. In addition, a similar pattern-effect exerted by anticoagulants was observed on HMEC-1 and HUVEC viability. Specifically, while 22&#x02013;28% of HUVEC death was found after 24 h of incubation with non-calcium treatments, cellular viability was significantly increase after CaCl<sub>2</sub> addition (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After restitution of calcium, not significant differences on viability were observed between SC-PRPr and -ACD. Therefore, and similar with proliferation and migration findings, the effect of anticoagulants is extended to different types of endothelial cells.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>The effect of calcium restitution and citrate-anticoagulants in endothelial proliferation and migration mediated by PRPr. <bold>(A,B)</bold> Platelets contained in SC-PRP and ACD- were lysed to release total amount of platelet-derived growth factors and then coagulated or not with CaCl<sub>2</sub>.

Instead, the current preparation methods are focused on the hemostatic functions of platelets for transfusion purposes. Unlike these protocols where platelets containing anticoagulants are administered intravenously, during regenerative protocols platelets (and their additives) are administered locally in damaged tissues which are often not vascularized. Thus, it is conceivable that the elimination of anticoagulant during these local administrations differs from those described for systemic administration. Our hypothesis is that anticoagulants exert a harmful and local effect that interferes with the regenerative proprieties of platelets. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of SC and ACD on the overall angiogenic and regenerative responses targeted by platelets.</p><p>Through <italic>in vitro</italic> studies we first demonstrated that the calcium-chelating effect exerted by SC and ACD alters the morphology of endothelial cells resulting in the inhibition of endothelial proliferation and migration mediated by platelet releasates. These results agree with the fundamental concepts about the role of calcium-signaling pathways in cellular biology. Calcium is a second messenger essential for the homeostasis of all cellular and tissue processes and it triggers the activation of several metabolic steps including cellular death (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Moccia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Dubois et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bootman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Paudel et al., 2018</xref>). We also found that endothelial viability was reduced in the absence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> suggesting that decrease of angiogenic responses observed in non-calcium conditions could be partially explained by endothelial death. After restitution of calcium, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells were normalized when PRP was obtained with SC but not with ACD. In these conditions, diminution on endothelial viability by anticoagulated-PRPr or significant differences between SC-PRPr and ACD- were not observed. Thus, differences between treatments at physiologic levels of calcium would not be explained by a cytotoxic effect of anticoagulants. Other possibilities to explain this anti-angiogenic phenomenon could be attributable to a cytostatic effect exerted by anticoagulants. In addition, a metabolic effect of citrate independent of its anticoagulant proprieties cannot be rule out. It could include the alteration of intracellular pH, acid-based homeostasis and intracellular citrate metabolism traditionally demonstrated in the context of urine metabolism (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Hamm, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, the anti-angiogenic effect of ACD has not been reported in previous studies that evaluated proliferation of other cells induced by PRPr <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Lei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">do Amaral et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, and in contrast with our experimental settings where cells were incubated with medium containing 100% of PRPr, the previous reports were performed using complete culture medium supplemented with 1&#x02013;20% of PRPr suggesting that the effect of anticoagulants could have been bypassed by dilution. Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that the dilution of PRPr with saline between 25 and 50% increases the angiogenic and regenerative responses mediated by platelets. This phenomenon was explained by the optimal balance reached after dilution between pro- and anti-angiogenic factors derived from platelets and plasma, respectively (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Etulain et al., 2018</xref>). Now we propose that another benefit of using diluted PRPr is the consequent reduction of anticoagulants additive in the solution.</p><p>In agreement with the <italic>in vitro</italic> results, our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings indicated both, that calcium supplementation is crucial to restore the regenerative ability of anticoagulated-PRP and that wound healing is delayed by ACD regardless the presence of calcium. In addition, the presence of intradermal inflammatory infiltrates was observed in the periphery of wounds treated with ACD-PRPr. These anti-regenerative and pro-inflammatory responses observed with ACD-PRPr were reproduced when SC-PRPr was supplemented with glucose (18 mM) indicating that glucose derived from ACD interferes with regeneration mediated by platelets. Accordingly, and although normal levels of glucose (5.5 mM) are essential for cellular metabolism, it is well known that intermedia or high levels of this molecule (10&#x02013;30 mM) exert anti-angiogenic, inflammatory and cytotoxic effects that contributes to the development of chronic wounds in patients with diabetes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Shakya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Hu and Lan, 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, a delay in wound healing or the presence of inflammatory papules were not observed in mice injected with glucose alone (saline + glucose controls) indicating that these phenomena are not induced by glucose alone but in combination with PRPr. In the same line of evidence, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study has demonstrated that glucose alone (15&#x02013;25 mM) failed to induce cellular activation processes required for the infiltration of neutrophils into inflamed tissue as chemotaxis and adhesion. However, in combination with the chemoattractant stimulus fMLP, both inflammatory cellular responses were synergistically increased in the presence of glucose (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Oldenborg and Sehlin, 1999</xref>). In addition, a previous work published by our group has demonstrated that inhibition of <italic>in vitro</italic> angiogenic responses (including endothelial proliferation, migration, survival and tubule formation) induced by TNF-&#x003b1; is increased in combination with glucose (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Mena et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that glucose synergizes with other stimuli to enhance pro-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic responses. It is well known that platelet alpha granules not only contain growth factors but other molecules including cytokines and chemokines (e.g., SDF-1&#x003b1;, IL-8, IL-17, TNF-&#x003b1;, RANTES, ENA-78, MCP-1) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Etulain et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Amable et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Andia and Abate, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Anitua et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that local cytokines derived from platelets act in combination with glucose to induce the recruitment of inflammatory cells into the dermis, and to inhibit the angiogenesis required during wound healing and tissue regeneration. It is also conceivable that local presence of high glucose levels induces the activation and cytokine production from tissue and immune cells as it is traditionally known in the context of diabetes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Donath et al., 2019</xref>). The requirement of glucose in anticoagulants and preservative solutions have been stablished to avoid lysis of erythrocytes during storage of these cells for transfusion (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mollison, 2000</xref>). Considering that red cells are not required for using PRP for regenerative purposes, the addition of glucose could be avoided, and SC could be used as anticoagulant instead of ACD.</p><p>Finally, and according with a recent publication about the effect of diluting SC to increase fibroblast proliferation mediated by PRPr (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Anitua et al., 2016</xref>), we found that half reduction of SC and ACD resulted in the improvement of endothelial proliferation and migration mediated by PRPr. In contrast, platelet-mediated regenerative responses were only improved by reduction of SC but not ACD indicating that anti-regenerative effect exerted by this anticoagulant is not prevented by dilution. This phenomenon might be associated with the persistence of inflammatory infiltrates in 1/2ACD-PRP impeding the resolution of inflammation required during wound healing (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Sorg et al., 2017</xref>). In agreement with our data, two recent studies have showed that PRP obtained from anticoagulated blood is better to induce proliferative and regenerative responses mediated by platelets (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Miron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2018</xref>). One of these studies has demonstrated that mouse skin wound closure is faster induced by PRPr prepared without anticoagulant than ACD-PRPr (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2018</xref>). Controversially, the development of intradermal inflammatory papules after ACD-PRPr injection was not mentioned in this study. Of note, it is unknown whether the inflammatory phenomenon that we have observed using Balb/c mice could be also developed in Nude mice that have an alteration of immune system, not only in T-cells but also a defective activation of granulocytes and monocytes (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Wysoczynski et al., 2017</xref>). Besides these discrepancies, we agree that using non-coagulated blood is a physiological alternative to reduce the harmful effect of anticoagulants. However, spontaneous coagulation of blood obtained without anticoagulant constitutes a limitation in handling times from blood extraction to PRP application. Thus, reduction of anticoagulant could be an alternative balance to reduce the anti-regenerative effect of anticoagulants allowing convenient manipulation. Indeed, and in agreement with Anitua findings (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Anitua et al., 2016</xref>), in preliminary settings we have observed that basal levels of hemostatic functions of PRP (including aggregation and coagulation) were similar and completely inactivated between total and half concentration of anticoagulants-PRP. In agreement again with Anitua (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Anitua et al., 2016</xref>), activation responses induced by stimulus addition (as PAR-1 activated peptide) were similar induced in the presence of both concentrations of anticoagulants, but they were reached 20&#x02013;40% faster in treatments containing half amount of SC or ACD (data not shown). Thus, hemostatic proprieties of PRP are conserved in treatments containing half amount of anticoagulants.</p><p>Extrapolation of our findings to the clinic might explain the inflammatory reactions observed in patients after receiving regenerative and local treatments with PRP (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Kaux et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Alam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Latalski et al., 2019</xref>). These complications were not associated with the presence of leukocytes in PRP since all the interventions were performed using free-leukocyte PRP. Of note, all of these procedures were performed using PRP anticoagulated with ACD and without calcium restoration arguing about a possible toxic effect caused by the anticoagulant. Unfortunately, and in contrast with the industrialized medical drugs that require pharmacovigilance, the heterogeneity of platelet-derived products hinders the establishment of regulatory frameworks worldwide required to apply a mandatory and unified record of side effects (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Anitua et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Beitzel et al., 2015</xref>). To count with more of these registers would allow a deeper understanding about the adverse effects of anticoagulants used in regenerative protocols mediated by platelets allowing providing therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat these complications.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclussion</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that reduction of calcium levels exerted by citrate-anticoagulants interferes with the angiogenic and regenerative proprieties of platelets. This effect is reversed by restitution of calcium levels. <sc>D</sc>-Glucose (Dextrose) contained in ACD confers anti-angiogenic, anti-regenerative and inflammatory proprieties to PRP suggesting that, in contrast with protocols for obtaining blood-derivatives for transfusion, SC could be considered for obtaining platelets for regeneration.
